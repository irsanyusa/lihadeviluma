They were at the peak of their career, enjoying the adulation of the masses, and suddenly they were gone.</p><p>All deaths were attributed to drug and alcohol abuse, homicide or suicide. The "club" was eventually forgotten — until 2011, when a security guard discovered <strong>Amy Winehouse</strong>'s limp body in her London apartment. The cause of the British singer's death was drinking too much alcohol. Her peers couldn't get over it.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-5>27 Club: Celebrities who died young</h2></p><p>The "27 Club" is back in the spotlight following the recent death of <strong>Chance Perdomo</strong>, whose role as Ambrose in Netflix's <strong>Chilling Adventures of Sabrina</strong>, brought him fame.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-e4f606c5-5b31-4221-901c-065e0d6d40d5 data-caption="Chance Perdomo [Getty]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/X1cktkpTURBXy9hZjJjMDRmYTdiYjEyYWZhYjc1NmM0OTUzMWQxYWRjNC5qcGeRlQLNAxbNAxbCww></span><p>Here are some of the most famous members of the 27 club:</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-10>1.

On July 3, 1969, he was found floating face down in his own swimming pool. Theories quickly emerged that he was murdered, but the coroner soon dispelled doubts by announcing that the artist died as a result of an accident.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-13>2.

On September 18, 1970, his addiction defeated him. Hendrix, unconscious and unresponsive, was taken to the hospital and was immediately pronounced dead. Cause: barbiturate overdose.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-16>3.

Manager, <strong>John Cooke</strong>, rushed to her room at the Landmark Motor Hotel in Hollywood. He planned to get her out of there, but a terrifying sight met his eyes: dead Joplin lying on the bed with change in one hand and cigarettes in the other.</p><p>There was no trace of heroin, although a syringe was found near the body. According to Los Angeles County Coroner, <strong>Thomas Noguchi</strong>, the missing evidence was removed from the scene by one of the star's friends. But the truth could not be suppressed, and it was this: Joplin had overdosed.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-21>4.

But the question of why he died persisted far beyond the short time he spent on Earth. Morrison was seen unconscious in the bathtub of a Parisian hotel by his girlfriend, <strong>Pamela Courson</strong>. She called for help, but it was too late.</p><p>He had died of heart failure caused by a heroin overdose. Before the world knew what had happened, he was buried in the Père Lachaise cemetery.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-25>5.

He also caused scandals with the equally rebellious <strong>Courtney Love</strong> as a partner. On April 5, 1994, he was dead. The musician's body was found in a greenhouse above the garage of his house. A shotgun rested on his chest.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-28>6.

The car crushed the 27-year-old's lungs, and investigators concluded that he died within 60 seconds of impact.</p><p>It was an unimaginable shock for Anton's parents. They soon sued Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, which produces the Jeep Grand Cherokee, and after a court battle they signed a settlement for an unspecified amount of compensation. The money obtained went to, among others: account of the Anton Yelchin Foundation supporting young artists.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-32>7.

The concert in Belgrade was supposed to start the European tour. However, the performance turned out to be a nightmare - Amy had trouble concentrating, couldn't remember the lyrics and was probably too drunk to stand on stage. Instead of helping her, security reportedly forced her to continue with the concert. The audience booed her. It was the singer's last concert.</p><p>She died on July 23, 2011 as a result of alcohol poisoning. She was 27 years old.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>This article was originally published on <a href=# id=5d63bf40-05e0-4019-a69b-65c48abf734c data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>Onet Woman</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGZrb12YubaujJycpZ2Sp7a1tcSsZLCgn2KxqrHDZrCorZ6cfHO30rJurGw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f27-club-celebrities-who-died-young.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f27-club-celebrities-who-died-young.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f27-club-celebrities-who-died-young.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f27-club-celebrities-who-died-young.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f27-club-celebrities-who-died-young.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f27-club-celebrities-who-died-young.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./1259690-funny-bald-jokes-bald-friend-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./1259690-funny-bald-jokes-bald-friend-html.html>Funny bald jokes to tell your bald friend</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./liza-on-demand-season-2-most-watched-youtube-original-1203367160.html>Liza on Demand Season 2 Has YouTubes Most-Watched Original Debut to Date (EXCLUSIVE)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./liza-on-demand-season-2-most-watched-youtube-original-1203367160.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
