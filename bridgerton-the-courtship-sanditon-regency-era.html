And the dating reality show <i>The Courtship</i>, currently airing on the USA network, dresses its bachelors in breeches, flies them to England, and makes them pay homage to a hopeful bride and her family—wooing her the old-fashioned way.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Regency era, named so because England’s Prince Regent sat on the throne due to his father’s illness at the turn of the 19th century, is once again popular right now. So what exactly, in 2022, is the appeal of a time in European history best known for the Napoleonic wars?</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>The enduring influence of Jane Austen</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/bridgerton-1.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Regency era lives on in the cultural imagination as a time of romance, especially for independent-minded heroines finding love in unlikely places, thanks to both Jane Austen, whose novels like <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> and <i>Emma</i> continue to inspire adaptations, and the popular Regency Romance genre, which encompasses period-accurate novels in the style of writer Georgette Heyer as well racier, more modern-feeling novels with Regency settings, like Quinn’s. That instant association—divorced from the broader scope of history—has allowed creators like Rhimes and <i>Bridgerton</i> showrunner Chris Van Dusen to serve up romantic heat on a particularly elegant platter, just in time to reach an audience starved for escapism and pleasure.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The COVID-19 pandemic drove readers to “the comfort food” of Regency fare, according to Laurel Ann Nattress, who runs the fan site <a href=# rel=noopener>Austenprose</a>. Nattress says her site saw a surge of interest in novels and films about the Regency era when COVID-19 lockdowns began, a good several months before <i>Bridgerton</i> released. And once it debuted in 2020, <i>Bridgerton</i> was a cultural giant, quickly becoming the most-watched shows on Netflix at the time of its premiere. The popularity likely played a part in the revival of <i>Sanditon</i>, says Margaret Sullivan, author of <i>The Jane Austen Handbook</i> and editor of <a href=# rel=noopener>Austenblog</a><i>.</i> The show was renewed for a second season after fan organizing that included a <a href=# rel=noopener>massive beach art project</a>, a <a href=# rel=noopener>88,000-signature petition</a>, and numerous social media campaigns. “<i>Sanditon</i> was dead, it was buried. There was a very persistent fandom, but I think they should thank Shonda Rhimes,” Sullivan says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong><a href=#>Read More: What Jane Austen Can Teach Us About Staying Home</a></strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Austen, whose six novels appeared between 1811 and 1818, has long saturated the culture. The thriving Regency Romance genre is full of witty lines that obliquely reference her work. In the first episode of <i>The</i> <i>Courtship</i>, Austen quotes are mangled for “comic” effect, every few minutes. The social conventions of her novels—women’s dance cards being filled up by suitors, hunting parties, dinners around long tables—are familiar enough to viewers that the universe is easy to slip into. Seeing the low-cut dresses and tight breeches of Regency England in <i>The Courtship</i> likely evokes Matthew MacFayden’s Mr. Darcy flexing his hand with desire in <i>Pride & Prejudice, </i>or a similar scene of longing from another Austen film (In fact, there’s a tumble into a lake in season 2 of <i>Bridgerto</i>n that directly references the infamous Colin Firth “wet shirt” scene in the 1995 <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> miniseries).</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>Reimagining the Regency era in 2022</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/the-courtship-nicole-remy-women.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Beyond Austen, the Regency era remains “vague” in the popular consciousness, says Lynn Festa, a professor of English literature at Rutgers University. “Everyone knows the Victorian period, the British Empire. But the Regency is a bunch of bonnets,” she says<b>.</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In reality, Festa says, the Regency era was built on vast “structures of exploitation.” Austen’s writing includes brief references to the way slavery’s profits fed the lifestyle of British society, a bitter truth that is examined more openly in the new season of <i>Sanditon</i>. The social stratification, abject poverty, and oppression of women we might associate with the Victorian era was present in the Regency era, too. Yet our cultural imagination doesn’t go to these troubling places as quickly, opening the door to what <i>Bridgerton</i>’s creators have described as a “fantasy” Regency that, while rooted in history, is actually more tolerant and harmonious than what you might find in 2022 America—a universe where interracial relationships receive no condemnation, women speak their mind, escape to the seedy side of town, and flirt with few lasting consequences, while every good parent ultimately counsels their child to choose love over convenience. In season 2 of <i>Bridgerton</i>, the heroines are the Sharmas, sisters newly arrived in England from Bombay. They are easily welcomed, despite a few raised eyebrows about their mother’s hasty marriage. Brexit-era England, this is not.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Both <i>The Courtship </i>and <i>Sanditon</i> have racially diverse casts and characters, too, marking a departure from previous Austen-inspired efforts. <i>Sanditon</i>‘s supporting cast features a Black heiress (as written by Austen) who is best friends with the heroine, and <i>The Courtship</i> gives its heroine, Miss Rémy, also a woman of color, regal authority over not just her love life, but the whole conceit. The ideal of racial coexistence presented by these series fits in with the optimism of the Regency Romance genre, in which happy endings tend to resolve interpersonal and social tension, heroines narrowly get away with flouting convention, and heroes are always talented at satisfying their wives in bed. The <i>Bridgerton</i> team gestures at this: technicolor costumes, string quartets playing contemporary pop songs, and cheeky cutaways remind the audience that even in serious moments, this is supposed to be fun. It’s hard to forget, especially in the lighter, more humorous second season.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The equation of a Regency story with a final, well-earned wedding scene helps explain why fans of <i>Sanditon</i>, which was based on an unfinished Austen fragment, organized so passionately for its revival after the first season closed with unexpected heartbreak. The “Sanditon Sisterhood’’ expressed a yearning that many fans of onscreen romance feel. The classic, well-made rom-com (itself descended from Austen) <a href=# rel=noopener>has faded from its prime place</a> in the film landscape, barring an occasionally delightful exception. In its place, shows like <i>Bridgerton</i> and <i>Sanditon</i> can offer us the kind of swoon-worthy moments we don’t see elsewhere, <a href=# rel=noopener>like the Duke and Daphne</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>holding hands in a gallery</a> in <i>Bridgerton</i>’s first season, and in <i>Sanditon</i>, a scene <a href=# rel=noopener>where the love interests row a boat</a>, hands touching, which became the subject of many, many<a href=# rel=noopener> fan-made Youtube videos</a>. In the new season of <i>Bridgerton</i>, the heroine herself flashes back to these “slow burn” moments where she almost kissed the hero—rattling her porcelain teacup with the heat of the memories. To add to the fun, at least on <i>Bridgerton</i>, the characters eventually go further.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I think that’s what appeals to a lot of people that might not even like Jane Austen,” Sullivan says. “Actual sex scenes.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As many <a href=# rel=noopener>writers</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>critics</a> have <a href=# rel=noopener>noted</a>, there is a tightrope being walked between conservative and progressive approaches in this approach, as in any kind of art that explores history with an inclusive modern touch, like <i>Hamilton</i>. <b>I</b>n the face of deep society-wide issues like America’s unfinished racial reckoning, #MeToo, and the pandemic, the romance plot is undoubtedly a kind of retreat from the broad to the narrow. <i>The Courtship </i>is honest about this, offering Miss Rémy the world of ballrooms and sitting rooms as an explicit antidote to the complexity of modern life, and especially modern dating.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It’s a bit retrograde, to be sure. But there’s also something delightful in the way these Regency shows openly cater to a largely diverse, largely female audience, so much so that this historical era, which was deeply oppressive for people of color and women, has become a vehicle for their enjoyment and fantasy fulfillment. It’s an impressive feat. No wonder we’re all tuning in.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For more of TIME’s culture coverage, subscribe to our entertainment newsletter, More to the Story, by clicking <a href=# rel=noopener>here</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvaWZlhXd9jpupopyXmr%2B1u81mq6GdXZi8tr7TrJ%2BiqF2orq%2BwyK2mp2WimrSmusKyZJ6qkWQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbridgerton-the-courtship-sanditon-regency-era.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbridgerton-the-courtship-sanditon-regency-era.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbridgerton-the-courtship-sanditon-regency-era.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbridgerton-the-courtship-sanditon-regency-era.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbridgerton-the-courtship-sanditon-regency-era.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbridgerton-the-courtship-sanditon-regency-era.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./lady-gaga-slams-music-industry-at-sxsw-keynote-dont-sell-out-to-this-business-1201133455.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./lady-gaga-slams-music-industry-at-sxsw-keynote-dont-sell-out-to-this-business-1201133455.html>Lady Gaga Gives SXSW Keynote: Dont Sell Out to This Business</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./oertlichkeiten-klima.html>Bereisen Sie Wales | Wie kommt man nach Wales?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./oertlichkeiten-klima.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
