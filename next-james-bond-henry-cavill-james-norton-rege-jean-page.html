The rumor mill is beginning to heat up, even though “Bond 26” won’t go into production until 2024 at the earliest, with Hollywood strikes possibly delaying production even more. But with stories flying about who Bond producers are meeting with, fans are hoping it might soon be revealed who will take over as Ian Fleming’s iconic character.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Here’s what we do know: The new Bond will almost certainly not be the familiar 007. If the next film follows the timeline of “No Time to Die,” then James Bond is dead and Lashana Lynch’s character Nomi adopted his MI6 agent number. Of course, the next Bond movie could easily set that established timeline aside, and take place in an alternate Bond universe altogether. (It never made much sense that Sean Connery’s Bond from the 1960s and Pierce Brosnan’s Bond from the 1990s were the same person, anyway.)</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">So before diving into our extensive list of possible candidates, it’s worth acknowledging that producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael Wilson have been clear about three things: The next Bond should be played by a Brit; the next Bond should be young enough to be able to continue in the role for at least 15 years; and the next Bond will be a man, not a woman.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Of course, as Agent 007 knows better than most, rules are meant to be bent, if not broken outright. So as the James Bond franchise turns 60, we looked at actors born in the Commonwealth, at actors well into their 60s and 70s, and, yes, at several actors who are women. The most important criteria was if the actor could bring the necessary gravitas, style and charm to playing Britain’s most famous secret agent.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Aaron Taylor-Johnson</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1409933596.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Beyond the charm, Bond is an adrenaline junkie with destructive and promiscuous tendencies — a role that British actor Taylor-Johnson certainly knows how to fill following his 2016 performance as villain Ray Marcus in the psychological thriller “Nocturnal Animals.” Taylor-Johnson’s execution of the part landed him a nomination for best supporting actor at the BAFTAs that same year. The 32-year-old star is also known to audiences as Dave Lizewski in the action-comedy “Kick-Ass,” Pietro Maximoff in Marvel’s “Avengers: Age of Ultron” and a wise-cracking hitman in “Bullet Train.” His breadth is proof that the malleable actor can handle both the dark, justice-hungry and quick-witted, idealistic sides of 007.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Damson Idris</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1466597545.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Snowfall” actor Damson Idris is the latest British actor who is rumored to have auditioned for the Bond producers. Bookmakers in the U.K. were quick to put him near the top of the list of Bond prospects when the news of the purported audition came out. The 31-year old actor was born in London to Nigerian parents, and started his career acting onstage before getting playing Franklin Saint, an American drug dealer, in the series “Snowfall.” He went on to appear in shows such as “Black Mirror” and “Swarm.” An experienced football and rugby player, he hasn’t yet had extensive experience in thrillers and large-scale productions, but his athletic background could be an asset during rigorous action sequences.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Richard Madden</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1191974405-e1664326048811.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><br>After conquering two major fandoms — Marvel and “Game of Thrones” — Richard Madden is ready for another franchise. As the King in the North — aka Robb Stark — the Scottish actor was no stranger to action, having excelled in his epic “Game of Thrones” battle scenes. Madden earned a Golden Globe for his role in “Bodyguard” as Sergeant David Budd, a war-veteran-turned-protection-officer who suffers from PTSD, and he looks the part of an intense yet dapper Bond. His characters (including Ikaris in Marvel’s “Eternals”) may be softer at heart than the sometimes callous 007, but the new Bond ought to be more evolved than his predecessors. The 36-year-old’s biggest obstacle will be his role in another action-packed spy series: the Russo brothers’ upcoming Amazon Prime Video show “Citadel,” in which he stars opposite Priyanka Chopra Jonas.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Regé-Jean Page</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1419659641-e1664666651592.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The “Bridgerton” breakout first stirred Bond suspicions when he tweeted “Regency, royalty. Shaken and stirred” before the wildly popular Netflix series’ Season 1 premiere. Since then, the 34-year-old has certainly acquired a fan base who would love to see him as the next 007 – and he’s currently leading the odds, with Oddsmakers predicting a 5 to 2 chance that he’s cast. With his dashing good looks and charming delivery, there’s no doubt Page would make a fantastic Bond – and he would bring some much-overdue diversity to the franchise. Though he proved his status as a heartthrob in “Bridgerton,” he’s also sharpened his action chops, having recently starred in Netflix’s blockbuster “The Gray Man.” What’s more, his career has just started to take shape over the last few years, putting him in that sweet spot between unknown and superstar that could make for a long and fruitful Bond run.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>James Norton</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1337738793-e1664316071211.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He’s been a brutal sociopath (in “Happy Valley”), a tipsy vicar (in “Grantchester”) and a conman (in “Rogue Agent”). Raised in North Yorkshire, the 37-year old falls just in the upper age range of the ideal Bond, but his piercing gaze and seductive smile put him squarely in the league of actors who can provide both sex appeal and action chops. Norton started out in theology school and pursued Buddhism before turning to acting full-time, which could help him bring a soulful dimension to the super-spy. For his role in mini-series “McMafia,” he rocked a tux, learned martial arts and spoke in Russian – all excellent skills for the next Bond.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Henry Cavill</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1059210246-e1664322248442.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">It’s a bird, it’s a plane – it’s James Bond! Though most people know British actor Henry Cavill for playing Superman in the DC Extended Universe, he’s built up quite the spy repertoire as well, starring as international agent Napoleon Solo in 2015’s “The Man From U.N.C.L.E.,” evil assassin August Walker/ John Lark in “Mission Impossible – Fallout” and taking on icon Sherlock Holmes in the “Enola Holmes” films. All this to say, Cavill knows his way around action, and has even performed his own stunts as the lead on Netflix’s “The Witcher.” And let’s be honest, Cavill has the charming good looks to back up Bond – though he’s almost 40, we can only imagine he’d age like fine wine over the next decade or so. Ultimately though, he may be too well known for sporting the Superman cape to take on another iconic role.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Henry Golding</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1151282909-e1664324696414.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The “Crazy Rich Asians” breakout has already proven himself to be everything Bond should be – British, dashing and in on the joke. In a short time, Golding has shown that he is not only a deft actor in a hit rom-com, but adept with thrillers (“A Simple Favor”) and action (“The Gentlemen,” “Snake Eyes.”) He’s still new enough to make it an exciting pick, yet also has shown he can carry a movie. And for those who feel Bond has gotten far too serious, Golding can also bring a charming levity to the screen – a twinkle in the eye that his best predecessors also shared.<br></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Lucien Laviscount</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Lucien-Laviscount.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He’s Emily’s current love interest in “Emily in Paris,” which brought Lucien Laviscount international attention, and now he’s being touted as a frontrunner to be the next James Bond. British TV viewers have seen him since he was a teen in recurring roles in series like “Grange Hill,” “Waterloo Road,” “Celebrity Big Brother” and especially, the long-running soap “Coronation Street.” In the U.S., he appeared in “Scream Queens,” “Snatch” and “Katy Keene.” Does the debonair Lancashire native have what it takes to don the Bond tuxedo? His feature roles so far have been scarce, but with charm to spare, the Daily Mail said, “Lucien ticks all of the boxes. He is a super-talented actor, is extremely handsome, and in the past 18 months has won lots of new fans since he joined ‘Emily In Paris.’ Bond bosses are already saying how you can see him in the 007 tuxedo, how dapper and fitting to the role he will look.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Dev Patel</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-646064494-e1664320215337.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The Gawain-to-James Bond pipeline might not be real yet, but if Dev Patel tackles the role of 007, he could give the franchise the reinvention the Bond producers seem to desire. The “Green Knight” actor’s portrayal of David Lowery’s conflicted hero establishes him as a potential action star, making him a good candidate to don the black suit and chase some bad guys. Plus, at 32, the BAFTA winner is young enough to carry the franchise on his shoulders for a few decades yet. (Not to mention — it might be no time to die, but Patel’s mustache is certainly to die for.)</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Andrew Garfield</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1401830183-e1664324352759.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">As 39-year-old Andrew Garfield’s star has continued to rise since his breakout role as Spider-Man, it’s become apparent that the Epsom-raised actor can play just about any role. Billionaire co-founder of Facebook? Check. Mormon detective who begins questioning his religion while uncovering a murder? Yep. Late composer and playwright Jonathan Larson (with the vocal chops to match)? Absolutely. So, there’s really no reason why he couldn’t absolutely smash the role of Bond, James Bond. In fact, his classical acting background (he trained at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama) could bring a certain theatrical flair to the character that sometimes gets lost in all the action sequences.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Tom Hardy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/TomHardy.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Besides Tom Hiddleston, there’s another Tom H. whose name has been thrown around for the next Bond: Tom Hardy. The A-lister’s slate may be too packed to fit in a decade or more as 007, but he’s already a bonafide action star. He’s risen to the challenges of “Warrior,” “The Revenant,” “Mad Max: Fury Road” and many more — heck, he even broke Batman’s back in “The Dark Knight Rises” and it looks like he may go toe-to-toe with Spider-Man as Venom in the near future. Hardy’s real-life jiu-jitsu skills could even come in handy the next time Bond needs to use hand-to-hand combat to take down a villain.&nbsp;However, at 45, he’s rapidly aging out of the preferred age range to go the distance.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Daryl McCormack</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1403151417-e1664322734947.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">McCormack cut his teeth acting in tough guy TV shows like “Vikings” and “Peaky Blinders” before breaking out this year with the Sundance hit “Good Luck to You, Leo Grande.” As the eponymous gigolo, the relative newcomer showed a smoldering intensity, sensitively and skillfully showing Emma Thompson the ropes in a hotel room for the film’s entire runtime. Quickly establishing himself as a strong screen presence, the Irish actor is primed to connect with audiences in a big way — he just needs some shoes to fill. And he can easily wear Bond’s Crockett & Jones oxfords for a decade or two since he’s only 29 years old.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Joe Alwyn</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1191956195-e1664320838217.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The internet’s favorite “London Boy” might be the plus one to the world’s biggest pop star, but Joe Alwyn’s performances as Henry Wallace in “Boy Erased” and unfaithful husband Nick in Hulu’s “Conversations with Friends” establish his abilities as an actor. A spy Nick is not — but suit the 31-year-old Grammy Award winner up and place him in a luxe location, and it’s not hard to imagine he has a license to kill. Alwyn-as-Bond could lend a boyish, sensitive edge to the debonair super-spy, not to mention expand the Fleabag-Sally Rooney-Taylor Swift-Phoebe Bridgers universe.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Jacob Elordi</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1240942974-e1664323298769.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">After Craig’s 15-year-long tenure, young people need a Bond to call their own — and it’s high time to return 007 to his roots as a professional, debonair psychopath. Who better for that than Elordi, the hunky 6’5’’ Aussie — still the Commonwealth! — who adds an unmistakable menace to “Euphoria” and “The Kissing Booth” trilogy. He plays Elvis Presley in Sofia Coppola’s next film — arthouse clout alert! He’s also a distinctive, but largely unquantified screen presence that audiences haven’t solidified a relationship with: an effective reboot demands a blank canvas. Most importantly, he’s only 25 years old. That means plenty of time to make five or six or 19 new films.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>John Boyega</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/JohnBoyega.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">John Boyega has already mastered one massive franchise with Star Wars, so why not another? If you’ve seen the body of this actor’s work, you know Boyega is stocked with charm, intensity and sincerity. And at just 30 years old, he’d be eight years younger than Craig when he started with “Casino Royale.” Imagine a youthful Bond, just learning the ropes, still patriotic for King and country (or whatever). Think more George Lazenby cool-guy, less angsty “No Time to Die” Bond.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Michaela Coel</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1341346230-e1664668582136.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The Broccoli family has explicitly stated they are looking for a man to fill 007’s shiny black dress shoes, but Michaela Coel would be the perfect choice for a female Bond. The creator and star of award-winning miniseries “I May Destroy You,” the effortlessly elegant Coel also showed off her acting chops in “Black Mirror” and “The Aliens.” Plus, she’s set to star in “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” and get her spy on in the “Mr. and Mrs. Smith” Amazon series. If a female Bond isn’t in the cards, maybe the next script could make room for a powerful new MI6 agent like Coel.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Jamie Dornan</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1388058686-e1664666338246.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Who better to follow in the Irish footsteps of Pierce Brosnan than Jamie Dornan? Coming off two critically lauded (and extremely different) roles in “Belfast” and “Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar,” Dornan’s more than proved he’s capable of captivating an audience, especially in intense roles like Irish TV series “The Fall.” (Whatever you think of “Fifty Shades of Grey,” there’s a reason he was cast as its enigmatic, brooding lead.) And yet, Dornan’s upcoming list of projects is currently pretty scant —a shame, but at least that means he’d be available to take on a whole new franchise that plays to his particular skills.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Jonathan Bailey</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1404745350-e1664667526589.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Another “Bridgerton” boy, Bailey is a talented actor on the stage and screen. A thespian since he was a child, the 34-year-old has an extensive list of credits in theater and television, including recent West End phenomenon “Cock” and Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s comedy series “Crashing.” However, his film repertoire is quite short (besides his recent casting as Fiyero in the two-part “Wicked” film adaptation), leaving lots of room to establish himself as Bond. As anyone who has seen “Bridgerton” can attest, Bailey has an impressive capability for portraying passion – something that could translate to Bond in the form of both his spy escapades and many lovers. And with Bailey identifying as gay, perhaps the Bond franchise could see its first LGBTQ lead.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Lashana Lynch</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/LashanaLynch.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">It’s a deceptively simple solution for the next Bond: Continue the story with Lashana Lynch’s character Nomi from “No Time to Die.” Her character already took up the 007 mantle from Daniel Craig’s Bond, and she proved to be a worthy, badass successor in his final outing. Lynch clearly has the action chops — look no further than her stunning turn in “The Woman King.” It would be a radical passing of the torch for the franchise, but give Nomi a fresh cast of new and familiar characters and send her off on some spy adventures in the wake of Craig’s Bond’s death.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Will Poulter</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/willpoulter.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Fresh off an Emmy nomination for “Dopesick” and at a young-but-not-too-young 29 years old, Will Poulter may be in a prime spot to play the next Bond. He’s just landed what could be a major, breakthrough role in “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,” but many recognize him from a variety of 2010s films like the raunchy comedy “We’re the Millers,” YA sci-fi “The Maze Runner” and indie horror “Midsommar.” An action blockbuster, like a Bond film, may be his next calling. Plus, he’s already bulked up and gotten into top shape for his “Guardians of the Galaxy” role.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Ṣọpẹ́ Dìrísù</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/sopedirisu.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">On top of channeling an unmatched intensity in his performances, Dìrísù’s candidacy for the role of James Bond is largely derived from the actor’s breadth of experience working in the espionage genre. The British Nigerian actor began gaining recognition for his role as undercover detective Elliot Finch on the crime drama “Gangs of London,” resulting in his nomination for the Rising Star Award at last year’s BAFTAs. But can Dìrísù pull off the nonchalance of Bond’s signature “ladies’ man”? The answer would prove to be yes, as seen through the actor’s embodiment of handsome bachelor Mr. Malcolm in the period piece “Mr. Malcolm’s List” — breeches and coattails never looked so good.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Idris Elba</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Idriselba.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The people’s choice. The minute Craig announced he was done with the double 0, one name was constantly circulated as the next Bond: Idris Elba. Range, gravitas and smoldering good looks, Elba has it all. Countless actors, producers and directors have all campaigned for his Bond residency. And for a while, it really felt like we might actually see Elba in that perfectly cut tux. Alas, the actor has said he’s not interested but has encouraged the gatekeepers to “do something different” with the casting. And to be honest, at 50 years old, he might not feel like sticking with the franchise possibly for more than a decade to come.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Jodie Turner-Smith</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/jodieturnersmith.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Following a breakout starring role in 2019’s “Queen & Slim” and another co-starring role in this year’s “After Yang” opposite Colin Farrell, Jodie Turner-Smith’s acting chops are undeniable and magnetic. Should the “Bond” series decide to make a massive switch with a woman star, Turner-Smith could prove a wildcard pick that would not disappoint. For those with hesitancies about her action sensibility, see 2021’s Michael B. Jordan-led “Without Remorse,” in which she portrayed a highly capable lieutenant commander.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Marwan Kenzari</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1150918386-e1664326648607.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">When the first looks of Disney’s live-action “Aladdin” dropped, audiences were already abuzz, not about the title character or even Will Smith’s genie, but the actor playing villain Jafar. And that was just the trailer. Marwan Kenzari brought real stakes and intensity to what had previously been a literal cartoon character and the actor only increased his popularity with a fantastic turn in the action flick “The Old Guard.” The Dutch actor, who comes from a Tunisian family, has more action on his plate: in addition to a sequel to “The Old Guard” he’s set to appear in “Black Adam.” He’s blockbuster and franchise-friendly and ready to take the lead.<br></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Nikesh Patel</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1164250103.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Londoner Patel saw increasing attention with the premiere of HBO Max’s “Starstruck,” a chaotic, romantic-comedy about a millennial who finds out she’s been sleeping with A-list actor Tom Kapoor, played by Patel. Through his performance, Patel has mastered the confident swagger and self-assurance that are indispensable to Bond’s character archetype. Most recently, Patel also wrapped production on Prime Video’s upcoming British thriller series “The Devil’s Hour,” where he plays an empathetic detective leading a manhunt. From romance to thrillers, Patel’s eclectic filmography is sure to aid in a multi-layered performance that effectively captures Bond’s complex psychology.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Kedar Williams-Stirling</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Kedar.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Williams-Stirling became a sex icon overnight with his break-out performance as misguided athlete Jackson Marchetti in Netflix’s “Sex Education,” but could the swoon-worthy actor be swapping Speedos for sky-blue Orlebar Brown trunks? The Manchester-native has previously made appearances on other television series like action feature “Shank,” Shakespeare series “Will” and teen fantasy “Wolfblood” as well as lower-budget features like “Changeland,” but starring in the next Bond film would surely launch the burgeoning Netflix star into high-profile feature roles.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Emily Blunt</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/EmilyBlunt.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">If the Broccoli estate were ever to budge on the idea that James Bond can’t be a woman, they could do worse than to enlist the talents of one Emily Blunt. She’s one of the U.K.’s most immediately compelling and recognizable actors, but only has a few more upcoming films before she’s free for more. She’s the right age (just shy of 40)&nbsp;to commit for several films worth. She can be sharp and calculated in one scene and tender and heartbreaking the next. Also, anyone who’s seen her extremely impressive action work in “Edge of Tomorrow” — which should be more of you, “Edge of Tomorrow” rules — will know that Blunt is more than capable of handling the physical rigors that the role requires. &nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Matt Berry</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1148678743-e1664671160926.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Let’s add a dash of humor to Bond, shall we? “What We Do in the Shadows” star and U.K. alt-comedy mainstay Matt Berry is a perfect goofball in a debonair suit, an unconventional ladies’ man whose velvety voice and idiosyncratic pronunciations would make Bond girls swoon. Add his long coif and thick beard for “Shadows” and you could tap into a new type of fan. Plus he’s an accomplished singer and songwriter…could he be the first Bond to croon his own theme?</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Joseph Quinn</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1177110187-e1664669930315.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">If Bond producers are looking to go with a younger 007, its hard to imagine a better fit than Joseph Quinn, the 28-year-old Brit who became a worldwide sensation with just a handful of episodes of “Stranger Things.” After stealing every scene as Eddie Munson with pure charisma, just imagine what Quinn could do with his own franchise. And if he could pull off Eddie’s Heavy Metal hair and 1980s garb, imagine how fetching he would look in Bond’s tuxedo.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Riz Ahmed</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1314427976-e1664665819371.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">&nbsp;There are few actors — especially ones who are British and nearing 40, or otherwise — whose charisma rivals Riz Ahmed. As a keen producer, British-Pakistani, and magnetic performer in projects as varied as “The Night Of,” “Sound of Metal” (for which he got an Oscar nomination) and “Rogue One,” Ahmed would undoubtedly find a new way in to one of cinema’s most iconic and well-trod roles. That he would also look incredible in Bond’s signature tuxedos is just the icing on the cake.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Jason Wong</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/jason-wong-gq-men-of-the-year.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Jason Wong would certainly have no problem with Bond’s stunts, having practiced Wing Chun kung fu and Brazilian jiu-jitsu for years. Although Wong is not a household name, his portrayal of Dralas in the highly anticipated “Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves” could be the 36-year-old actor’s breakout role. In addition to his extensive martial arts repertoire,&nbsp;Wong has starred in such action films as “The 355” and “Wrath of Man,” making him a reasonable candidate&nbsp;to become&nbsp;the first Asian Bond.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Alfred Enoch</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/alfredenoch.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Hailing from notable franchises like “Harry Potter” and “How to Get Away with Murder,” British actor Alfred Enoch is a sleeper pick for the next 007. The actor’s warm smile can flash well during moments where Bond needs to work his charm to push his mission forward, while his physicality, which had notably been on display during a 2016 theater production of “King Lear,” can shine on full display when Bond needs to save the day.&nbsp;Enoch also had a recurring role on sci-fi series “Foundation,” and will appear in Anand Tucker’s upcoming thriller “The Critic.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Nicholas Hoult</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/nicholas-hoult-2019.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">With his piercing blue eyes and boyish charm, Nicholas Hoult has been a heartthrob since his days as Tony Stonem in the British dramedy series “Skins.” The 32-year-old actor has proven his versatility in action films, from wielding medieval weapons in “Jack the Giant Slayer” to unleashing the mutant Beast in the “X-Men” franchise. Not to mention, Hoult has managed to woo viewers with such unlikely characters as the undead R in “Warm Bodies” and the psychotic Nux in “Mad Max: Fury Road,” so there’s no denying that “The Great” star can incorporate a similar complexity and allure to Bond.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2><strong>Delroy Lindo</strong>&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-517356020-e1664325432971.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">This London-born actor’s actor checks off all of the boxes: suave, cool, sophisticated, looks great in a tux. Sure, he’s turning 70 this year, but let’s pair him with an age-appropriate femme fatale (Michelle Pfeiffer, Angela Bassett, Michelle Yeoh, etc.) who could give him a run for his money.&nbsp;Even if he has to rely on his wits more than his brawn, how can you resist the idea of a grown and sexy Bond sidling up to you at the bar? The idea has us shaken and stirred.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Pierce Brosnan</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/PierceBrosnan.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">It’s not unprecedented for Bond actors to come back after a break. Sean Connery was enticed to don the bow tie once again for 1971’s “Diamonds Are Forever” after a less successful try by George Lazenby in 1969’s “On Her Majesty’s Secret Service.” Pierce Brosnan’s unceremonious dismissal from the role of James Bond after starring in four financially successful 007 movies still rubs countless fans the wrong way, and many continue to hold out hope that the 69-year old Irish actor might one day return to the franchise in a standalone adventure, not unlike Hugh Jackman’s late-period Wolverine film “Logan.” And considering that Brosnan’s final Bond film, “Die Another Day,” was the highest-grossing entry in the series up to that time, it’s clear that his popularity in the role was never in question. So why not give him a respectful swan song worthy of his talents? After all, Brosnan not only still looks fantastic with his striking silver hair and rugged sexiness, but ever since leaving Bond behind he’s turned in some of the best work of his career in films like Roman Polanski’s “The Ghost Writer,” the hit “Mamma Mia!” movies and the AMC series “The Son.” Perhaps, then, it’s finally time to renew his license to kill.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Fabien Frankel</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/fabienfrankel.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Resident Westeros hunk Fabien Frankel has proven throughout the first season of “House of the Dragon” that he can handle the heat. The breakout star, who plays Dornish heartthrob Criston Cole, doesn’t have many credits to his name. But the late-20’s actor has plenty of time ahead to fulfill the Broccoli family’s 15-year requirement. Plus, if he can wield a longsword, why not a PPK pistol?</p></li></ul><h4 class="o-nav__title lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-whitespace-nowrap lrv-a-font-primary-s o-nav__title a-content-ignore
