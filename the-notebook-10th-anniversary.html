<time>14 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/noah-and-allie.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I will admit that when I first watched The Notebook, it was under less than ideal circumstances. I was 13, and I watched the DVD (rented from Blockbuster—yes, Blockbuster still existed) with my parents while on vacation. My view of what many argue is the best part of the movie—that <a href=# rel=noopener>one scene in the rain</a>—was obscured by a book my mother was desperately waving in front of the TV in an effort to preserve my innocence. And I’m pretty sure I missed a good 15 minutes of the plot setup making popcorn. But I remember thinking the film was sappy and stupid.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Most people don’t agree with me. The 2004 film, which is based on a 1996 Nicholas Sparks novel, is now a cultural phenomenon. In particular, the famous kissing scene is now so iconic that it’s constantly <a href=# rel=noopener>clipped</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>parodied</a>. It’s also developed into an audience favorite: it may have a score of 52 from critics <a href=# rel=noopener>on Rotten Tomato</a>, but audiences have given the 2004 romantic drama an 85.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So given <a href=# rel=noopener>how much people love this movie</a>, I decided to give it another shot. At 13 I hadn’t yet fallen in love or had my heart broken, and I probably didn’t have a firm grasp on what Alzheimer’s really was. So as a world-weary 23-year-old who is far more susceptible to tearjerkers, I re-watched <i>The Notebook </i>for its 10th anniversary. And it was even more terrible than I remember. Here’s why.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>1. This is not a healthy relationship</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When it comes down to it, we actually know very little about Noah and Allie as a couple. Here’s what we do know: they like to put themselves in dangerous situations; people are always walking in on them having sex in that one house; and they fight all the time.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The first bad sign was when Noah climbed up on that Ferris Wheel and threatened to kill himself by letting go if she didn’t go out with him. Sure, it seems cute in the movie, but imagine if a guy did that in real life. You would think he was seriously unstable. Another bad sign: on their first date, he almost got her run over by a car by lying in the street. Excellent.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Then we see them laughing a lot together and shoving ice cream cones in each other’s faces—you know, cliché scenes that movies use to indicate people are in love. But we also see them screaming at each other. This usually ends with her slapping him in the face or punching his chest. After she’s bruised him a bit, they start making out. (Could people make out that much in public in the 1940s?) I get it. They’re passionate: They fight and then they have great sex. That’s their thing. But that doesn’t translate to long-term stability and reading to each other in the nursing home. Just saying.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>2. You know she ends up with Noah</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I’m not even going to use a spoiler alert on this one because anyone who can put two and two together will realize James Marsden’s character would not be telling a love story in which Ryan Gosling’s character is portrayed in such a positive light. Knowing the end of the movie doesn’t necessarily ruin it, but I’ve gotten into arguments with friends about the merits of this film in which they posit that there is a moment when you think just maybe Rachel McAdams is going to end up with the wrong guy. She’s not. She’s going back to Noah because Noah is telling her the story at the end. Sorry, Lon. You never had a shot.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>3. E from Entourage deserved to go with a little more dignity</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But it was a war. Someone had to die.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>4. The movie has at least five endings</strong></p><li>Rachel returns with her suitcases to the house Noah built for her. They hug. Cut to black. You don’t get to see them when they’re old again, but let’s be real: they put Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling on the poster, not the old couple. You came to see the young, hot people kiss.</li><li>Rachel remembers Noah. They live happily ever after at least for that moment.</li><li>Rachel forgets Noah. A twist! The movie ends in a sad note. But this is Hollywood, so that’s not happening.</li><li>Noah has a heart attack. We assume he dies of a broken heart. But again, too depressing.</li><li>The actual ending: they die in the night together. Whether you think it’s cheesy or not, you’re pretty happy they’re dead at this point because it means the movie finally has to end.</li><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>5. The Princess Bride did the grandpa reading a love story schtick better</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And It’s a Wonderful Life did the whole dream of one day fixing up an old house and then doing it schtick better.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>6. Enough with the birds!<br></strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The director hits you over the head with a bird metaphor. There are weird CGI birds flying at old Allison at the beginning of the movie as she looks over the lake. Rewind to when they’re young and Allison demands that Noah say she’s a bird. He refuses to do it. Why? Because if she’s a bird, she might fly away. She whines a bunch, and finally he agrees she’s a bird, and he’ll be a bird too because he’ll go where she goes.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But of course he’s not a bird because she’s a pretty swan with money and opportunities, and he’s a land-bound animal without a cent to his name. So swan = rich girl. That’s why when they’re back in the boat seven years later rowing through, like, a thousand swans, he says the birds will “go back where they came from” like he assumes she will.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The credits roll at the end of the film against a background of—you guessed it—birds. Except this time the birds are a metaphor for their souls leaving their bodies? Because they’re flying away together? Like Allie wanted? Get it?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Conclusion: too many birds.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>7. Allie’s dad has an evil person mustache</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Which means you already know her parents are going to try to split them up.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This movie is filled with clichés: poor guy falls in love with rich girl; snobby parents pull them apart; fate “stepping in” so that Noah sees Allie just as he’s about to give up on her; Allie sees Noah’s picture in the paper as she’s being fitted for a wedding dress; kissing in the rain; Allie’s mom was faced with the exact same choice as she is; old people dying together. But you would have thought they would have been above slapping a cartoonish mustache on a villainous character.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>8. Trying to get Allie to remember everything just seems cruel</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I know it’s supposed to be romantic, but isn’t it a little bit selfish for Noah to try to make Allie remember everything when he knows she’ll forget in a few minutes? When she begins to forget, she finds herself in a vulnerable situation with what she thinks is a stranger and justifiably freaks out. Doctors rush in and giver her a sedative. It just seems mean. Even the kids are not on board with the plan.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>9. I’m not alone. Top critics didn’t like it either</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“There’s no way to endure the movie without earplugs and a blindfold.” —<a href=# rel=noopener>Peter Travers in Rolling Stone</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Cassavetes isn’t much of a director and he never settles on a mood, which he seems intent on ruining with hiccups of goofiness.” —<a href=# rel=noopener>Manohla Dargis in the Los Angeles Times</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Considering the sunny, relatively pleasurable romantic business that precedes it, the elderly stuff seems dark, morbid, and forced upon us.” —<a href=# rel=noopener>Wesley Morris in the Boston Globe</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">All that said, I really like both Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams as actors. The plot wasn’t their fault. And yeah, that was a pretty good kiss. No wonder they dated in real life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZrcWFuhHJ%2Bjq2fnmWepMGmrs6oomZpYKm1bq3Np6CvnaKorrPFjg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-notebook-10th-anniversary.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-notebook-10th-anniversary.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-notebook-10th-anniversary.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-notebook-10th-anniversary.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-notebook-10th-anniversary.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-notebook-10th-anniversary.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./a-cruel-viral-tweet-that-shames-pierce-brosnans-wife-quickly-backfires-816998.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./a-cruel-viral-tweet-that-shames-pierce-brosnans-wife-quickly-backfires-816998.html>A Cruel Viral Tweet That Shames Pierce Brosnans Wife Quickly Backfires</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./les-contrats-de-destination-ca-marche.html>les contrats de destination, a marche !</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./les-contrats-de-destination-ca-marche.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
