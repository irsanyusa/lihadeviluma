One woman, who is&nbsp;absolutely happy in&nbsp;her <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a>, is&nbsp;losing it&nbsp;because of&nbsp;her mother-in-law’s possessive behavior towards her husband. The woman wrote a&nbsp;post where she described the details of&nbsp;her family relations, which have become hard to&nbsp;handle and she’s seeking advice from people who might have been in&nbsp;a&nbsp;similar situation.</p><p><h2>It&nbsp;all started a&nbsp;while ago, but now things got critical.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3b2/460/5cc5995d97bf175d3c769be099.jpg><p>A&nbsp;desperate woman, 35, wrote to&nbsp;us, in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;tell her complex family story. She didn’t hide her <a href=# title=emotions data-link=tag>emotions</a>, while writing her candid letter, and there was a&nbsp;mixture of&nbsp;disappointment, irritation and a&nbsp;huge desire to&nbsp;solve the life dilemma that appeared in&nbsp;her happy family. She started her story saying that she and her husband, both 35&nbsp;years old, have been happily married for over 5&nbsp;years. They have 2&nbsp;<a href=# title=kids data-link=tag>kids</a>, a&nbsp;son and a&nbsp;daughter, 2&nbsp;and 4&nbsp;years old.</p><p>Their family has always been a&nbsp;happy one, with the spirit of&nbsp;<a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a>, mutual care and understanding prevailing in&nbsp;everything they do&nbsp;together. The woman confessed that she’s still madly in&nbsp;love with her husband, whom she first met when she was 16&nbsp;years old. She then recalled their first meeting and the day when she was introduced to&nbsp;her husband’s mom, who would soon become her mother-in-law and the root of&nbsp;all evil in&nbsp;her family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/185/1e2/9ca5175acf9df80ca864114a02.jpg><p>The woman told that the first meeting with her husband’s mom was warm and cordial, but she already had a&nbsp;feeling that the woman was too possessive toward her son. She recalled how her then-boyfriend’s mom asked her plenty of&nbsp;questions, trying to&nbsp;find out everything about her family, her background and even the tiniest details about her relationship with her son.</p><p>The weirdest question that she recalled was, “Were you in&nbsp;a&nbsp;relationship before you met my&nbsp;son? Why did your relationship with your ex&nbsp;come to&nbsp;an&nbsp;end?”. The woman wrote that at&nbsp;that time she thought that her husband’s mom just wanted to&nbsp;make sure her son was safe in&nbsp;a&nbsp;relationship with her and that nothing would make him unhappy, but she was mistaken: this was only the beginning and the first red flag.</p><p><h2>The situation in&nbsp;the family is&nbsp;now becoming more and more absurd.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ffb/442/5ec0c152dfa979f5acfc842d7a.jpg><p>The woman continues her story, saying, that they moved in&nbsp;together with her husband’s mom one year after their wedding. Her husband insisted on&nbsp;it, saying that his mom was feeling lonely and helping her then-pregnant daughter-in-law and then taking care of&nbsp;her grandchildren would be&nbsp;a&nbsp;good relaxation for her. The woman was silently against such decision, but didn’t want to&nbsp;hurt her husband’s feelings and didn’t object, thinking it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;temporary stay and that his mom would sooner or&nbsp;later be&nbsp;fed up&nbsp;with such a&nbsp;busy life and would return to&nbsp;her own home.</p><p>The woman writes, “My&nbsp;desire to&nbsp;please everyone played a&nbsp;bad trick to&nbsp;me. If&nbsp;only&nbsp;I could foresee what life&nbsp;I would be&nbsp;having when my&nbsp;MIL would move in&nbsp;with&nbsp;us! I’d have objected; I’d have spoken out against this bad decision.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fcb/437/c937355e099a35d89ad16e9598.jpg><p>After moving in&nbsp;with the spouses, the elderly woman slowly but surely took possession of&nbsp;everything in&nbsp;their house. She became the chef in&nbsp;the kitchen, preparing meals for both herself and her son and his kids. However, she wouldn’t cook for her daughter-in-law, saying that she had gained weight after giving birth and needed to&nbsp;go&nbsp;on&nbsp;a&nbsp;diet. She started interfering with the family budget, offering unwanted advice regarding how much her son spends on&nbsp;domestic needs and clothes. Then, she took over their kids, trying to&nbsp;become their “mother,” and, even more frustratingly, the woman revealed that she had even tried to&nbsp;tell her husband that she’s a&nbsp;bad mother and a&nbsp;bad wife.</p><p>The woman continues her story, saying that every time she and her husband had an&nbsp;argument, his mother took his side and tried to&nbsp;preach her for “inappropriate behavior,” leaving her no&nbsp;chance for solving her family conflicts herself. It&nbsp;soon came to&nbsp;the critical point when the spouses’ private space was severely violated and it&nbsp;was the last straw.</p><p><h2>When it&nbsp;all already seemed too much, the MIL went even further.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3e3/d24/e0ca20563dafd89daa07ef6e7b.jpg><p>The desperate woman continues her story with a&nbsp;shocking revelation that her mother-in-law somehow penetrated into their private space—the bedroom shared by&nbsp;her and her husband. She wrote, “Whenever my&nbsp;husband and&nbsp;I are in&nbsp;our bedroom, his mom appears in&nbsp;a&nbsp;doorway and asks him to&nbsp;go&nbsp;sleep with her because she’s scared. She explains it&nbsp;all by&nbsp;saying that since she became a&nbsp;widow, her late husband comes to&nbsp;her in&nbsp;her dreams, and it&nbsp;makes her scared to&nbsp;death. Only if&nbsp;my&nbsp;husband sleeps by&nbsp;her side can she peacefully fall asleep.”</p><p>The situation in&nbsp;the family has become so&nbsp;challenging that the woman is&nbsp;now completely against her husband’s mom. She can’t decide on&nbsp;how to&nbsp;make her move out of&nbsp;their house or&nbsp;even on&nbsp;how to&nbsp;hint to&nbsp;her that she is&nbsp;ruining her family.</p><p>We’d love to&nbsp;offer a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;advice to&nbsp;you and thank you for sharing this delicate story with&nbsp;us.</p><p><h2>Don’t be&nbsp;silent about your feelings and speak to&nbsp;your husband first.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/01d/ca2/81176f50069805daab706b2362.jpg><p>We’d recommend that you be&nbsp;braver in&nbsp;speaking out about what really bothers you regarding your mother-in-law. However, you should address your concerns not directly to&nbsp;your MIL but to&nbsp;your husband. Sit together and share your vision of&nbsp;your MIL’s continued stay with your family. You may avoid discussing their relationship and criticizing&nbsp;it, as&nbsp;this may be&nbsp;a&nbsp;vulnerable topic for your husband as&nbsp;well. Instead, focus on&nbsp;the main issue&nbsp;— the lack of&nbsp;private space for you and your husband, which may lead to&nbsp;relationship issues.</p><p>And here’s yet another controversial story about a&nbsp;tough MIL-<a href=#>relationship</a> that may bring severe consequences to&nbsp;a&nbsp;family.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6ecyoq6GdomK2r3nLmq5moaNisrnA0Z6knqSpYr2wv9Keqqyhppp6oq7Orqtmpalitba%2FwZqlnWWknbavs9Jmn5qulWKvpq%2FOppxmrZ6dsqK406GwZnBha4Nzgo4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmy-mother-in-law-is-extremely-possessive-about-my-husband-things-have-become-unhealthy-816626.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmy-mother-in-law-is-extremely-possessive-about-my-husband-things-have-become-unhealthy-816626.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmy-mother-in-law-is-extremely-possessive-about-my-husband-things-have-become-unhealthy-816626.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmy-mother-in-law-is-extremely-possessive-about-my-husband-things-have-become-unhealthy-816626.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmy-mother-in-law-is-extremely-possessive-about-my-husband-things-have-become-unhealthy-816626.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmy-mother-in-law-is-extremely-possessive-about-my-husband-things-have-become-unhealthy-816626.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./spice-girls-victoria-beckham-13533.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./spice-girls-victoria-beckham-13533.html>Spice Girls Reunite and Perform 'Stop' Dance at Victoria Beckham's 50th Birthday Party</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./meet-daniella-karagach-the-latest-dancing-with-the-stars-pro-superstar.html>Meet Daniella Karagach, the Latest 'Dancing with the Stars' Pro Superstar</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./meet-daniella-karagach-the-latest-dancing-with-the-stars-pro-superstar.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
