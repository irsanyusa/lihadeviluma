<time>10 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>A&nbsp;woman, 37, has written a&nbsp;letter to&nbsp;our editorial and dropped a&nbsp;bombshell from the start, saying that she forbade her in-laws to&nbsp;even approach her <a href=# title=kids data-link=tag>kids</a> and cut all ties with them during just one day. This all happened when she accidentally found out from her husband some nasty details about the times when he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;child. And now the woman is&nbsp;sure that her in-laws are pure evil for her kids and her <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>.</p><p><h2>Woman liked her in-laws from the start and it&nbsp;was mutual.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b68/cc6/a104aa5098a2cc0cbbf0cb1ed9.jpg><p>A&nbsp;woman named Jodie, 37, has recently sent a&nbsp;letter to&nbsp;our editorial, and she began it&nbsp;with a&nbsp;very emotional statement.</p><p>Jodie wrote, «Hi, <strong>Bright Side</strong>, I’m writing to&nbsp;you because&nbsp;I know that you have a&nbsp;big audience from all over the world, and&nbsp;I would like to&nbsp;hear other people’s opinions about my&nbsp;tough and controversial situation, and also about my&nbsp;categorical decision which is&nbsp;now very much criticized by&nbsp;many of&nbsp;my&nbsp;family members.»</p><p>The woman began her story, saying that she has made a&nbsp;decision to&nbsp;cut all ties with her parents-in-law, and she even forbade them to&nbsp;approach her kids. And then, Jodie told&nbsp;us the details of&nbsp;her <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> with in-laws and explained what led her to&nbsp;such a&nbsp;crucial and somewhat merciless decision.</p><p>Jodie wrote, «We&nbsp;were once very close with my&nbsp;in-laws. They seemed very nice, cordial and very hospitable people from the start. My&nbsp;husband Jake and&nbsp;I have been married for over a&nbsp;decade now, and we&nbsp;have 3&nbsp;wonderful kids together. During all this time, my&nbsp;parents-in-law have been extremely nice to&nbsp;all of&nbsp;our kids, and the children enjoyed their really nice relationships with their grandparents. As&nbsp;far as&nbsp;we&nbsp;know, they have only warm, happy memories with grandma and grandpa.»</p><p><h2>Jodie’s husband had a&nbsp;bizarre relationship with his parents.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/655/6f5/c510245ff3a33d4247a8cb6ca3.jpg><p>Jodie goes on&nbsp;with her story, saying, «I&nbsp;was happy that our kids have loving and caring grandparents. I&nbsp;lost my&nbsp;own parents due to&nbsp;a&nbsp;bad accident many years ago, and for&nbsp;me, it&nbsp;was important that the kids should have at&nbsp;least one set of&nbsp;grandparents, who would spoil them and love them unconventionally. My&nbsp;in-laws coped with this task pretty well, and&nbsp;I was satisfied with how their relationship with their grandkids was developing over time.»</p><p>However, Jodie’s husband seemed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;skeptic about this idyllic family picture. Jodie shared, «Jake didn’t object when in-laws came to&nbsp;visit the kids, but it&nbsp;had always been obvious that he&nbsp;was uncomfortable about that. He&nbsp;seemed to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;very distant and reserved relationship with his parents, and he&nbsp;had never initiated any meeting with them.<br>I&nbsp;never asked him about the reasons for such behavior, because&nbsp;I thought that if&nbsp;there was something to&nbsp;tell me&nbsp;about, he&nbsp;would do&nbsp;it&nbsp;out of&nbsp;his own initiative when he&nbsp;feels ready for sharing this. Otherwise, I&nbsp;tended to&nbsp;think that it&nbsp;was their family matter and&nbsp;I preferred to&nbsp;have my&nbsp;own opinion on&nbsp;my&nbsp;in-laws.»</p><p><h2>One day, Jake dropped a&nbsp;bombshell, telling Jodie about his childhood.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/761/ae3/12c566517ab0aedb280cb2960f.jpg><p>Jodie revealed, «Jake has been struggling with <a href=# title=depression data-link=tag>depression</a> and <a href=# title=anxiety data-link=tag>anxiety</a> for as&nbsp;long as&nbsp;I remember him. I&nbsp;know that he’s a&nbsp;sensitive guy, and his peculiarity has always been that he&nbsp;takes everything too close to&nbsp;his heart, sometimes overreacting to&nbsp;many unimportant things. That’s the way he&nbsp;is&nbsp;and has always been, and&nbsp;I only tried to&nbsp;help him with his therapy and fighting his anxiety.»</p><p>Jodie goes on&nbsp;with her story, saying, «One day, Jake came home from work in&nbsp;a&nbsp;really bad mental state. I’ve never seen him crying before, and I’ve never seen him so&nbsp;frustrated and desperate. I&nbsp;asked him about what happened, and he&nbsp;said he&nbsp;had a&nbsp;nervous breakdown because of&nbsp;some serious problems at&nbsp;work. But I&nbsp;had that gut feeling that there was something more serious than problems at&nbsp;work, so&nbsp;I insisted that we&nbsp;should sit and talk.»</p><p>Jodie revealed the reason for Jake’s long-term depression and anxiety. The woman explained, «I&nbsp;was expecting that Jake would tell me&nbsp;something about his present problems, but he&nbsp;suddenly started talking about his childhood. I&nbsp;was so&nbsp;shocked to&nbsp;reveal that my&nbsp;dear, my&nbsp;loving and caring parents-in-law were actually the main reason why Jake has been struggling so&nbsp;much during all his adulthood.»</p><p><h2>Jodie’s husband had a&nbsp;real childhood trauma.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/29f/c1c/2c11975657a8f053f262579e8c.jpg><p>Jake revealed that his parents tried to&nbsp;«parentify» him when he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;child and, then, a&nbsp;teenager. That means they would act like he&nbsp;was the grown-up person in&nbsp;the family, not them, and they often made him listen to&nbsp;their adult problems, they expected him to&nbsp;provide emotional support for them. He&nbsp;was expected to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;source of&nbsp;comfort and reassurance, not them.</p><p>Jodie wrote, «Jake told me&nbsp;how his dad was complaining to&nbsp;him, a&nbsp;10-year-old boy at&nbsp;the time, that he&nbsp;lost his job because of&nbsp;his colleague’s intrigues, and he&nbsp;would share everything in&nbsp;details, and Jake had to&nbsp;sit and listen. They also made Jake take part in&nbsp;managing household finances, he&nbsp;was even responsible for caring for his younger siblings. This all was especially challenging for Jake, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;obviously did not have that emotional maturity or&nbsp;life experience to&nbsp;manage his own emotions, let alone those of&nbsp;his adult parents.»</p><p>Jodie added, «I&nbsp;find it&nbsp;appalling and deeply inappropriate, that my&nbsp;in-laws have been so&nbsp;toxic over the years and that they pretended to&nbsp;be&nbsp;kind to&nbsp;our kids. I&nbsp;called them right after&nbsp;I found out all the details of&nbsp;Jake’s childhood, but they said he&nbsp;was lying to&nbsp;me. Then, I&nbsp;just told them they shouldn’t approach our kids and that they’re unwanted guests in&nbsp;our house. My&nbsp;MIL was crying and asking me&nbsp;not to&nbsp;jump into decisions, but&nbsp;I didn’t want to&nbsp;listen.<br>I&nbsp;saw with my&nbsp;own eyes what they did to&nbsp;Jake with their „parentifying“ and&nbsp;I would never wish my&nbsp;kids to&nbsp;have to&nbsp;face the same dirty methods from my&nbsp;in-laws. I’m extremely judged and criticized by&nbsp;the rest of&nbsp;our family members, but&nbsp;I don’t care, as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;I’m guarded by&nbsp;my&nbsp;maternal wish to&nbsp;provide my&nbsp;kids with a&nbsp;healthy environment to&nbsp;live&nbsp;in. I&nbsp;don’t want them to&nbsp;have this impact from their toxic grandparents, so&nbsp;am&nbsp;I wrong to&nbsp;be&nbsp;cutting them off from our family completely?»</p><p>And here’s yet another dilemma of&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman, who had no&nbsp;other choice rather than to&nbsp;kick her own pregnant daughter out of&nbsp;the house, together with her 6&nbsp;kids, and this happened for a&nbsp;devastating reason. <a href=#>Read more</a> to&nbsp;find out why the woman had to&nbsp;act like this and why she doesn’t even regret it&nbsp;now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSmvsRmmq6spJ67qHnMsmShraOXrq%2Bw0manmqqVo8G0ec6uq2anlmK8tr6MpaCvnaNirqfAxKtkomWRmLCqsMSnq5qknK56s7HVnpilnZRiwamxyKtknZmioHqnrcyio7Jlo5qws7HTZm9qcGRrfXA%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwere-cutting-my-husbands-parents-out-of-our-lives-after-i-accidentally-revealed-their-dark-family-secret-818460.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwere-cutting-my-husbands-parents-out-of-our-lives-after-i-accidentally-revealed-their-dark-family-secret-818460.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwere-cutting-my-husbands-parents-out-of-our-lives-after-i-accidentally-revealed-their-dark-family-secret-818460.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwere-cutting-my-husbands-parents-out-of-our-lives-after-i-accidentally-revealed-their-dark-family-secret-818460.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwere-cutting-my-husbands-parents-out-of-our-lives-after-i-accidentally-revealed-their-dark-family-secret-818460.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwere-cutting-my-husbands-parents-out-of-our-lives-after-i-accidentally-revealed-their-dark-family-secret-818460.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./ligas-veut-lever-les-obstacles-aux-conversions-dhopitaux-en-structures-medicosociales.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./ligas-veut-lever-les-obstacles-aux-conversions-dhopitaux-en-structures-medicosociales.html>L'Igas veut lever les obstacles aux conversions d'hpitaux en structures mdicosociales</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./edouard-philippe-lance-la-transformation-du-systeme-de-sante-et-annonce-cinq-grands-chantiers.html>Edouard Philippe lance la &amp;quot;transformation du systme de sant&amp;quot; et annonce cinq grands chantiers</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./edouard-philippe-lance-la-transformation-du-systeme-de-sante-et-annonce-cinq-grands-chantiers.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
