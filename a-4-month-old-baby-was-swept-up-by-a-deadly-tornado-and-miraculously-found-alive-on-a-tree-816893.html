<time>09 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>There’re many skeptic people in&nbsp;the world, who keep saying that real miracles simply don’t happen. Sydney Moore, 22, is&nbsp;a&nbsp;mom of&nbsp;2&nbsp;little sons, and she can reassure anyone that wonders do&nbsp;exist. One of&nbsp;them has happened to&nbsp;her own <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>, when her 4-month-old baby miraculously survived in&nbsp;a&nbsp;tornado against all odds.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;tornado appeared all of&nbsp;a&nbsp;sudden and alarmed the whole town.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/1b8/3b1/e0d25754cd895c6f81f2e4c746.png><p>Sydney Moore, 22, and her happy family were just going through an&nbsp;ordinary day, full of&nbsp;everyday family routines, when the tornado siren <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>sounded</a> in&nbsp;their hometown of&nbsp;Clarksville, Tennessee. The parents had just put their two sons for an&nbsp;afternoon nap, when the strong <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wind</a> tore through their town. Sydney was with her 1-year-old son in&nbsp;the back bedroom of&nbsp;their mobile house when she heard the tornado picking&nbsp;up. The mom-of-2 described what was going on&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;huge sound, similar to&nbsp;an&nbsp;airplane flying directly over them.</p><p>Sydney said there was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>no&nbsp;warning</a> about it&nbsp;approaching, and their whole town was totally unprepared for this accident. She herself instantly moved to&nbsp;shield her son, Princeton, with her body.</p><p><h2>The family’s house was totally demolished by&nbsp;a&nbsp;deadly wind.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5f7/3a1/f8a4d35164b17cfb3703373b5a.jpg><p>Moore’s family used to&nbsp;live in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mobile home</a> before the accident hit. Their house appeared to&nbsp;be&nbsp;totally fragile and started collapsing immediately. The walls were just coming down, and the roar of&nbsp;the shredding tornado was coming together with pounding rains. Sydney’s partner was trying to&nbsp;save their 4-month-old son, Lord, who was sleeping in&nbsp;his bassinet, but the man was lifted off the ground and hurtled through the air, and so&nbsp;was the bassinet together with the baby.</p><p>Sydney climbed out from beneath the remains of&nbsp;her destroyed mobile home, cradling her 1-year-old son. The woman revealed that her kids never cried and were such good babies, and her son was silent as&nbsp;she was trying to&nbsp;get him out of&nbsp;the collapsing house.</p><p><h2>Sydney feared that her youngest baby was dead.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e53/e1d/0322a0541eb65d98b912e69e41.jpg><p>Sydney recalled that she and her partner just went into “fight or&nbsp;flight mode” trying to&nbsp;save their sons. But the youngest baby, Lord, was swept up&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;swirl of&nbsp;wind and the desperate mom said she even feared the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>worst</a>, that her baby was dead. Her partner, Aramis Youngblood, had his shoulder dislocated, and the worried dad spent some agonizing<i><strong> </strong></i>minutes in&nbsp;search of&nbsp;his youngest son. It&nbsp;seemed like a&nbsp;miracle when the father discovered Lord, lodged in&nbsp;a&nbsp;fallen tree about <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>30</a>&nbsp;feet from where their mobile home was.</p><p>Sydney recalled that the whole episode was like a&nbsp;scene from some movie, when she saw Aramis walking up&nbsp;in&nbsp;the pouring rain, with his clothes ripped, holding their baby in&nbsp;his arms.</p><p><h2>The mom now totally believes in&nbsp;miracles.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cc4/345/bce5fb5563aeb469b25e5c0492.jpg><p>Clarksville Fire Rescue worker Steven Bryant was one of&nbsp;the first people who responded to&nbsp;the accident that day. He&nbsp;said that he&nbsp;heard a&nbsp;group of&nbsp;people shouting and saw them running. A&nbsp;police officer was holding Lord in&nbsp;her arms.</p><p>The 4-month-old baby had a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>laceration</a> on&nbsp;his face. He&nbsp;was still breathing, but he&nbsp;was very quiet and covered in&nbsp;mud. Later, the baby was examined by&nbsp;medics, and they handed the baby to&nbsp;his mom, saying that he’s a&nbsp;perfectly healthy boy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e83/da7/5f5bed5650b43db9fd90ba5a19.jpg><p>Sydney now says that all her possessions were gone, but of&nbsp;course what really matters is&nbsp;that both of&nbsp;the kids survived. The youngest boy <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>looked</a> like he&nbsp;was placed on&nbsp;the tree gently, which seemed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;total miracle to&nbsp;the whole family. Sydney’s sister, Caitlyn Moore, recalled that among the remains of&nbsp;Sydney’s mobile home there was a&nbsp;box containing the ashes of&nbsp;their mother, who died last year. And the box was found completely undisturbed, too.</p><p>Caitlyn Moore started a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>GoFundMe</a> page to&nbsp;help her sister and two nephews to&nbsp;recover from this severe accident. And now the goal sum of&nbsp;$100,000&nbsp;is raised, but the donations still keep coming from people who are shaken and amazed by&nbsp;this family’s story and want to&nbsp;help and support them.</p><p>And here’re some useful <a href=#>lifesaving tips</a> on&nbsp;what to&nbsp;do&nbsp;if&nbsp;you are caught in&nbsp;a&nbsp;tornado.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK5ugIympqesmGK8rbCMm5ibsV2srrR50rCcqaxdqr1urthmmGaclZaxrcWMraarppGZvG6tzZ1kpqGilrC2uM6uqqWxXZu8trrDZpiloaaaerC6jJpkraqVmnp5fZVxcGxn</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fa-4-month-old-baby-was-swept-up-by-a-deadly-tornado-and-miraculously-found-alive-on-a-tree-816893.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fa-4-month-old-baby-was-swept-up-by-a-deadly-tornado-and-miraculously-found-alive-on-a-tree-816893.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fa-4-month-old-baby-was-swept-up-by-a-deadly-tornado-and-miraculously-found-alive-on-a-tree-816893.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fa-4-month-old-baby-was-swept-up-by-a-deadly-tornado-and-miraculously-found-alive-on-a-tree-816893.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fa-4-month-old-baby-was-swept-up-by-a-deadly-tornado-and-miraculously-found-alive-on-a-tree-816893.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fa-4-month-old-baby-was-swept-up-by-a-deadly-tornado-and-miraculously-found-alive-on-a-tree-816893.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./a-police-officer-breastfeeds-starving-baby-rescued-after-a-hurricane-817110.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./a-police-officer-breastfeeds-starving-baby-rescued-after-a-hurricane-817110.html>A Police Officer Breastfed a Crying Baby Who Went 2 DAYS Without Food, After a Deadly Hurricane</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./15-modern-celebrities-that-look-like-the-stars-of-the-past-799353.html>15 Modern Celebrities That Look Like the Stars of the Past</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./15-modern-celebrities-that-look-like-the-stars-of-the-past-799353.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
