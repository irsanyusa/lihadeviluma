<time>15 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Our reader, a&nbsp;34-year-old woman named Anna, has never even suspected that her beloved husband would turn into a&nbsp;real monster one day. And she could never have thought that this day would be&nbsp;the day when she was giving birth to&nbsp;their long-awaited and already loved kid. Anna wrote&nbsp;us a&nbsp;letter, where she candidly shared her story and she revealed that she taught her husband a&nbsp;cruel, but a&nbsp;very effective, lesson after his nasty behavior during the birth of&nbsp;their baby.</p><p><h2>Anna shared her complicated story in&nbsp;her letter to&nbsp;our editorial.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cf3/fc9/aa2e9a5e87897fe9036481a2c8.jpg><p>Anna, 34, has recently sent a&nbsp;letter to&nbsp;our editorial, and her story was both a&nbsp;cry for help and a&nbsp;message to&nbsp;all married people that they should trust each other and support each other in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a>. The woman experienced a&nbsp;really inappropriate, nasty and even vile behavior of&nbsp;her beloved husband right before she gave birth to&nbsp;their baby, and she decided to&nbsp;not leave it&nbsp;as&nbsp;is, and her revenge was epic.</p><p>The woman opened her letter, saying, “My&nbsp;husband and&nbsp;I have been happily married for over 10&nbsp;years now. I&nbsp;always thought that we&nbsp;did have an&nbsp;ideal relationship and&nbsp;I did believe that he&nbsp;loved&nbsp;me. But his behavior during the very important period of&nbsp;our life has made me&nbsp;question both his feelings and his personality.<br>We&nbsp;got in&nbsp;a&nbsp;serious fight before our daughter’s birth. He&nbsp;just casually suggested a&nbsp;paternity test for our baby when she was born. Let me&nbsp;explain my&nbsp;feelings about&nbsp;it. This was completely out of&nbsp;the blue, he&nbsp;didn’t provide any reason. I’m a&nbsp;part-time worker who works remotely with no&nbsp;male friends other than my&nbsp;brother.<br>I&nbsp;asked him if&nbsp;he&nbsp;was accusing me&nbsp;of&nbsp;infidelity, and he&nbsp;said he&nbsp;‘just wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;sure.’ And he&nbsp;went so&nbsp;far, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;kept bringing it&nbsp;up. He&nbsp;was constantly asking about it&nbsp;and the stress started to&nbsp;make me&nbsp;physically ill. I&nbsp;then told him that&nbsp;I didn’t want to&nbsp;talk to&nbsp;him and left to&nbsp;live in&nbsp;my&nbsp;brother’s house.”</p><p><h2>Anna was deeply offended, but she still tried to&nbsp;brighten up&nbsp;her relationship.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/956/8c9/dfc14958d784d011254399360f.jpg><p>Anna revealed, “I&nbsp;was desperate about our fight, I&nbsp;thought a&nbsp;lot about it&nbsp;and at&nbsp;some point&nbsp;I thought that&nbsp;I wanted to&nbsp;settle the things between&nbsp;us. I&nbsp;called him while&nbsp;I was gone and tried to&nbsp;work it&nbsp;out, but he&nbsp;refused to&nbsp;even talk to&nbsp;me.”</p><p>Anna is&nbsp;getting very emotional while recalling the things that started happening after their fight. She revealed, “After being so&nbsp;severely ignored and humiliated, I&nbsp;came home after 2&nbsp;days to&nbsp;grab some things while my&nbsp;husband was at&nbsp;work. And then&nbsp;I went into labor. I&nbsp;called him <strong>30&nbsp;times</strong>. Before calling my&nbsp;brother, who called him another half a&nbsp;dozen time himself while on&nbsp;the way to&nbsp;pick me&nbsp;up&nbsp;and then on&nbsp;the way to&nbsp;the hospital.<br>It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;horrible and <a href=# title=traumatic data-link=tag>traumatic</a> birth. I&nbsp;started crowning in&nbsp;the car and the doctor delivered my&nbsp;daughter in&nbsp;the back of&nbsp;my&nbsp;brother’s van because&nbsp;I was too far along to&nbsp;move&nbsp;me, before rushing me&nbsp;in&nbsp;when&nbsp;I kept bleeding. It&nbsp;was horrible. I&nbsp;hated it&nbsp;all.<br>My&nbsp;brother’s wife who is&nbsp;a&nbsp;nurse even told me&nbsp;she honestly thought&nbsp;I wouldn’t make&nbsp;it. I&nbsp;also opted for a&nbsp;hysterectomy as&nbsp;it&nbsp;came to&nbsp;that or&nbsp;something more dangerous. I&nbsp;only ever wanted one or&nbsp;none, but my&nbsp;husband wants a&nbsp;large <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>. I’m trying to&nbsp;bond with my&nbsp;daughter, but it’s been hard.”</p><p><h2>Anna and her brother decided to&nbsp;teach her husband a&nbsp;lesson.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/686/a9c/aac9255499a11d01c8e36d95d0.jpg><p>Anna revealed, “The point is&nbsp;that during this horrible period while&nbsp;I was returning from surgery (it’s been 10&nbsp;hours after I&nbsp;called), my&nbsp;husband finally responded. He&nbsp;immediately asked why&nbsp;I hadn’t answered his call. At&nbsp;that moment, my&nbsp;brother had my&nbsp;phone and both him and&nbsp;I were so&nbsp;angry. My&nbsp;brother then said to&nbsp;my&nbsp;husband, ‘Hey, it’s Derek, I’m at&nbsp;the hospital. She didn’t make&nbsp;it.’ And he&nbsp;turned the phone off.”</p><p>Anna wrote, “My&nbsp;husband rushed over and got to&nbsp;the hospital when&nbsp;I had just woken&nbsp;up. He&nbsp;started shouting, and the security forced him out. He&nbsp;then didn’t get to&nbsp;see our daughter until the next day because&nbsp;I was all the time asleep, and they needed my&nbsp;signature to&nbsp;allow him back.<br>My&nbsp;whole family thinks it&nbsp;was horribly cruel, but at&nbsp;the same time we&nbsp;all think he&nbsp;deserved&nbsp;it. My&nbsp;brother keeps telling my&nbsp;husband that&nbsp;I nearly died because we&nbsp;waited for him. My&nbsp;brother used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;mostly indifferent about my&nbsp;husband before, but now he&nbsp;absolutely hates him, you can see it&nbsp;in&nbsp;his face whenever my&nbsp;husband enters the room.”</p><p><h2>Anna feels lost in&nbsp;her life because of&nbsp;her husband’s attitude.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c9d/178/d5215253aaa5c61eb2db22d4ee.jpg><p>Anna wrote, “My&nbsp;husband is&nbsp;mad, and he&nbsp;won’t apologize. He&nbsp;yelled at&nbsp;me&nbsp;when&nbsp;I said that the only reason my&nbsp;brother had my&nbsp;phone was because he&nbsp;wasn’t there. I&nbsp;am trying to&nbsp;be&nbsp;as&nbsp;empathetic as&nbsp;I&nbsp;can, I&nbsp;realize he&nbsp;feels guilty. I’ve spoken to&nbsp;my&nbsp;therapist, and she says I’m having a&nbsp;shock from the trauma.<br>My&nbsp;MIL said that my&nbsp;family is&nbsp;horribly cruel for this ‘lesson’ we&nbsp;taught her son and that&nbsp;I should go&nbsp;no&nbsp;contact with my&nbsp;brother, and now my&nbsp;husband is&nbsp;saying the same.”</p><p>“I&nbsp;just don’t know what to&nbsp;do. It’s been hard even to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;the same room with my&nbsp;husband, and I’ve been sleeping in&nbsp;the guest room with my&nbsp;daughter. He&nbsp;brought up&nbsp;the paternity once, and&nbsp;I just told him to&nbsp;get out of&nbsp;my&nbsp;sight.<br>However, I&nbsp;just want more opinions because&nbsp;I just don’t know.”</p><p>And here’s a&nbsp;mind-stirring story of&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman, whose husband did a&nbsp;<a href=#>paternity test</a> on&nbsp;their kid and it&nbsp;came back negative. The woman never cheated on&nbsp;her husband, and she can swear by&nbsp;it. The couple were even more shocked when they decided to&nbsp;do&nbsp;the test once more, with the genetic material of&nbsp;both of&nbsp;them, and their family is&nbsp;currently living through a&nbsp;real nightmare.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6eceuqpuZnpl6o7HHmq2enF2eu26tjKeYrKypYsSixYywn6KklWK2bsPArGSipl2hrqO70WaqqGWZYsGiwcahq2agmaJ6onnLnqqsp55itaa4y2alnq6Vp3qnu9GgnK1laGaFen%2BPaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmy-husband-behaved-in-a-nasty-way-while-i-was-in-labor-so-i-taught-him-a-lesson-hell-never-forget-818930.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmy-husband-behaved-in-a-nasty-way-while-i-was-in-labor-so-i-taught-him-a-lesson-hell-never-forget-818930.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmy-husband-behaved-in-a-nasty-way-while-i-was-in-labor-so-i-taught-him-a-lesson-hell-never-forget-818930.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmy-husband-behaved-in-a-nasty-way-while-i-was-in-labor-so-i-taught-him-a-lesson-hell-never-forget-818930.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmy-husband-behaved-in-a-nasty-way-while-i-was-in-labor-so-i-taught-him-a-lesson-hell-never-forget-818930.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmy-husband-behaved-in-a-nasty-way-while-i-was-in-labor-so-i-taught-him-a-lesson-hell-never-forget-818930.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./nick-cannon-vows-to-live-up-to-jamie-foxxs-beat-shazam-legacy.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./nick-cannon-vows-to-live-up-to-jamie-foxxs-beat-shazam-legacy.html>Nick Cannon Vows to Live Up to Jamie Foxxs 'Beat Shazam' Legacy</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./happy-st-davids-day-2022.html>Happy St David's Day 2022!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./happy-st-davids-day-2022.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
