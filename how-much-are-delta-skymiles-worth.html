<time>02 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Delta Air Lines is one of the biggest airlines in the United States. It flies to 325 destinations in 52 countries and is a member of SkyTeam, a global airline alliance including airlines such as Air France, KLM, and Korean Air.</p><p>Terms and Conditions may apply to offers and benefits on this page.</p><p>Delta’s loyalty program, SkyMiles, offers members the opportunity to earn points by flying on the airline, engaging with the airline’s partners and using the airline’s co-branded credit cards. SkyMiles can be used for a limited number of reward redemption options, the most valuable of which is booking flights with Delta and its partners.</p><h2 id=the-value-of-a-delta-skymiles-point>The value of a Delta SkyMiles point</h2><p>The number of Delta SkyMiles required to redeem a Delta flight is loosely tied to the cash cost of the same ticket. Based on a sampling of main cabin flights within North America, we value Delta SkyMiles at 1.16 cents per mile. This is the value that most U.S.-based SkyMiles members can expect to get when redeeming SkyMiles for coach travel with Delta and its partners.</p><p>However, the value you get from your Delta SkyMiles can vary. When searching, we saw redemption values as low as 0.8 cents per point and as high as 1.6 cents per point. While the redemption value of SkyMiles is loosely tied to the cash price of the ticket, the value you get for your miles will vary. In some cases, you may be able to get increased value for your SkyMiles, such as if you redeem them during SkyMiles award sales or for international travel.</p><h2 id=how-to-calculate-delta-skymiles-value>How to calculate Delta SkyMiles value</h2><p>When you book with Delta Air Lines using SkyMiles, you can and should calculate the value that you are getting for your SkyMiles.</p><p>To calculate the value you get from your SkyMiles, you need to know three things:</p><ul><li>The cash price of the itinerary you want to book (Cash price).</li><li>The amount of taxes and fees charged on your award ticket (Award taxes).</li><li>The number of SkyMiles Delta charges for your award ticket (SkyMiles cost).</li></ul><p>With this information, you can easily calculate the value (cents per point) you are getting from your SkyMiles using the following formula:</p><p>SkyMiles value = (Cash price - Award taxes)/(SkyMiles cost) x 100</p><p>For example, if you were looking at this flight from Boston to San Diego on the 20th of October in Main Cabin:</p><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/personal-finance/static/60bfba7ff881a836e34b109dbf0d8ef0/6ff8b/delta-skymiles-1.png> </span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/personal-finance/static/2376dae4f7526141475f919348367d09/6ff8b/delta-skymiles-2.png></span><p>…your SkyMiles value calculation would be as follows:</p><ul><li>Cash price = $277.</li><li>Award taxes = $6.</li><li>SkyMiles cost = 24,000 SkyMiles.</li></ul><p>Subtract six from 277, divide this figure by 24,000, and then multiply what you have by 100. On this redemption, your SkyMiles value would be 1.13 cents per mile.</p><h2 id=how-to-earn-delta-air-lines-skymiles>How to earn Delta Air Lines SkyMiles</h2><p>You can earn Delta Air Lines miles by: flying with Delta and its partners, making purchases from and participating in promotions through SkyMiles partners, through the SkyMiles dining program and even by switching your home energy providers.</p><h3>Flying</h3><p>You can earn Delta Air Lines SkyMiles by flying with Delta and its partners. The number of miles you earn on Delta-operated and Delta-marketed flights is based on the total of the base fare and the carrier-imposed surcharges, but excludes any government-imposed taxes and fees. If you fly on a ticket purchased through one of Delta’s <a rel=nofollow href=#>partners</a> that isn’t marketed by Delta, you will earn miles based on the distance you fly and the specific airfare you book. Some exception fares like cruise fares, consolidator fares, and vacation packages earn miles based on the number of miles you fly.</p><h3>Partner programs</h3><p>Delta offers several partnerships that can help you pad out your balance of SkyMiles. The airline’s partnerships with Starbucks and Lyft will interest most SkyMiles members, but there are plenty of opportunities to earn miles with Delta’s other partners.</p><p>SkyMiles members who link their Starbucks app with their Delta SkyMiles account can earn one mile per $1 spent at most Starbucks locations. Lyft riders who link their Lyft accounts to SkyMiles can earn one mile per dollar spent on every Lyft ride in the U.S.</p><p>You can also earn Delta SkyMiles with your rental car reservations. Hertz, Dollar, Thrifty, Alamo, Enterprise, National, Sixt, and Europcar all partner with Delta. In addition, Delta offers miles on car rentals booked and completed through its car rental portal on its website.</p><p>Like other airlines, Delta SkyMiles offers a dining program, called SkyMiles dining. SkyMiles members can earn up to five miles per dollar they spend at thousands of participating restaurants. All you have to do is enroll your credit card with SkyMiles dining. When you dine at participating restaurants or takeout and delivery in the U.S. and pay with your enrolled credit card, you will earn SkyMiles.</p><p>Online shoppers can earn miles from SkyMiles shopping, a shopping portal with over 100 retailers. Earning miles through SkyMiles shopping simply requires registering with the portal. Once that’s done, when you click through to partner merchants in the SkyMiles shopping portal, you will earn SkyMiles for eligible purchases.</p><p>Finally, in several states, some energy providers offer SkyMiles based on monthly natural gas bills.</p><h3>Credit cards</h3><p>Like almost every other major airline, you can earn miles on Delta through its branded credit cards. Delta offers seven different co-branded credit cards in partnership with American Express. Delta-branded American Express cards offer the ability to earn SkyMiles on every purchase, plus increased earnings on purchases with Delta Air Lines and in select categories.</p><p>All of the Delta co-branded credit cards offer a welcome bonus for new cardmembers who have not had the card before. Delta also offers versions of most of its credit cards for small business owners.</p><h2 id=credit-cards-to-earn-delta-skymiles>Credit cards to earn Delta SkyMiles</h2><p>If you are looking to earn Delta SkyMiles using a credit card, check out Delta’s loyalty credit cards.

Membership Rewards is a rewards currency earned by many American Express cards, including the company’s flagship <span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><a class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="The Platinum Card(R) from American Express" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*4028089*,*field*:*LinkTagPDPUrl*,*api*:*cc*,*linkText*:*card_name*,*linkTarget*:*_blank*,*linkRel*:*sponsored*} rel=nofollow href=#>card_name</a></span>. You will pay a small amount of excise taxes when you transfer Membership Rewards to SkyMiles, but Membership Rewards are easy to earn and can be a great way to top off your Delta SkyMiles account if you need a few extra miles for an award flight.</p><h2 id=what-can-you-get-for-your-delta-skymiles>What can you get for your Delta SkyMiles?</h2><p>Most Delta SkyMiles members will get the most value from their miles by redeeming SkyMiles for flights on Delta and its partner airlines. Redeeming SkyMiles at Delta.com is simple. Either select “Shop with Miles” when searching for an itinerary on Delta.com or look to the top of the webpage and select “Miles” under “Show Price In:” when viewing itinerary options.</p><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/personal-finance/static/6917e242e97004f189488cf80828b58c/6ff8b/delta-skymiles-3.png></span><p>Delta SkyMiles can be redeemed for one-way, round-trip, and multi-city travel. Almost any itinerary bookable on Delta’s website should be bookable with SkyMiles as an award ticket.</p><p>In addition to flights for yourself, you can book flights for others using your SkyMiles, including people not traveling with you. Delta also offers options to redeem your SkyMiles for a limited number of other awards. In most cases, redeeming for something other than flights with Delta and its partners will mean accepting a lower value for your SkyMiles. Other options for redeeming SkyMiles include Delta SkyClub membership, Delta gift cards, Delta vacation packages and SkyMiles experiences.</p><h2 id=delta-skymiles-vs-the-competition>Delta SkyMiles vs. the competition</h2><p>Delta Air Lines SkyMiles offer a value of just over a penny a point for most redemptions.

The points have a relatively stable value of 1.16 cents per point, which is lower than most other U.S. domestic airlines’ point values.
