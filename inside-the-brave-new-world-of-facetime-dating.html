<time>09 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Its uncharted terrain for most people, and we're all kind of flying by the seats of our pants, says Gigi Engle, brand advisor and author of . It's like the Wild Wild West of virtual dating. It can be exciting because there are no rules, Engle adds, but at the same time, without standard dating scripts, FaceTime dates can be confusing to navigate.</p><p>Greg, 30, is actually finding himself having more intimate virtual first dates. Both he and his dates are opening up, delving into more personal topics, in a manner thats atypical for first flesh-and-blood dates. ( <a href=# id=bf57d0bf-cb79-3311-adc7-fcad9cd9e39b>Kinda reminds us of Love Is Blind!</a> ) Weve spoken about our own personal baggage and past relationship rather quickly, he says. I think people are more comfortable while theyre in their own homes and element. Theres nothing really holding you back.</p><p>Nevertheless, the feelings of expedited intimacy might not just have to with being at home. COVID-19 is always a topic of conversationand usually the first one. Normally, if someone asks "How are you," it's considered overly forthright to anything else than "Good, and you?" But during the pandemic, its more socially acceptable to say, Yeah, its been tough. Im not doing great. Being more honest and vulnerable about how youre feeling from the start of conversation sets an intimate tone for the rest of the date.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Gregs enjoyed the depth of his conversations so far. Ive really liked that its a no holding back kind of time," he says. "It just seems people are less closed off.</p><p>Still, Engle warns of being too intimate. People can get overly comfortable when conversing through a screen. Don't go launching into a ton of emotional unloading when you barely know this person, she says. They didn't ask to be your therapist; they want to get to know you as a date.</p><p>People can also act a little too casually, which is a big turn-off for Devin, 32. Shes been on four first dates while in self-isolation, all of whom she met on the dating app Hinge.</p><p>The first two men she FaceTimed showed up in their bed, lying on their pillow, which she found off-putting. For some reason, in the context of a virtual date, it makes me feel like youre hoping for some kind of webcam girl type action to unfold, she says. Not gonna happen!</p><p>To be clear, she's not asking men to show up in a tie and blazerwere all living out of our sweats right now, she acknowledgesbut try to put some effort into it, the way you would an IRL date. Shave, style your hair, put on a well-fitting shirt, maybe a short-sleeve button down or henley. After all, youre still putting in less work than you would for an IRL date, since youre not leaving your apartment.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Actually, staying at home speaks to another one of FaceTime dating strengths. Even though all my first dates were meh, I didnt have that post-meh-date sadness of Crap, I just wasted a good outfit on that guy, Devin says. I ended the call and was instantly back in the comfort of my own apartment, like magic.</p><p>Still, ending the call can prove problematic. The movie doesnt end, the check doesnt come at dinner, and the bar doesnt close, Engle says. So theres no clear way of ending a FaceTime date. Thats why she suggests setting a specific time before the date, providing a reason why you have to end at a certain time, like you promised your friends youd attend a virtual happy hour. If the date is going well, and you want to talk longer, just tell them youre going to skip the happy hour, Engle says.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-8cf3d8f4-7926-3046-a6c6-02206e5efba7 data-caption="There are so many texts I need to reply to"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/JtqktkuTURBXy9mZWYyNmM1YS0zNTg2LTRiMjMtODExYy1mNjdjMzUwNjA3MGUuanBlZ5GVAs0DFs0B4MLD></span><p>Jamaal, 30, whos been on three different FaceTime first datesall people he met through Instagram and dating appsnavigates the foreign virtual first date world honestly. I just ask them how theyd like the date to look, and we come up with something together. They decide if they want to do casual or more dressy attire, if they want to eat with each other, and so on. It takes the pressure away, he says.</p><p>While Jamaal has enjoyed FaceTime dates because its more socially acceptable to be transparent about how exactly youd like the date to manifest, he has struggled with his feelings for the person after the date. I have a hard time reading my own emotions, he says. Did I really enjoy the date or is the isolation simply me making long for human connection?</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Even though FaceTime dates are digital and the norms havent yet been established, Engle encourages everyone to treat virtual dates as if it were IRL dates. Be polite, be kind, and be yourself. And just like on a real date, remember that there is a need to follow up and say you had a nice time or if you don't see this going anywhere, she says. The same rules of human decency apply no matter the style of date.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZLqmutJmn56ZnKm1cLXNrKCdnV2ptaZ5wauYr51do7K4edaoqaWcXaSzbrLAnJytoZ2aeqWt06KloGejZb53g9Zy</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2finside-the-brave-new-world-of-facetime-dating.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2finside-the-brave-new-world-of-facetime-dating.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2finside-the-brave-new-world-of-facetime-dating.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2finside-the-brave-new-world-of-facetime-dating.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2finside-the-brave-new-world-of-facetime-dating.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2finside-the-brave-new-world-of-facetime-dating.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./salome-villeneuve-venice-1235367691.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./salome-villeneuve-venice-1235367691.html>Salom Villeneuve Explores Childhood Memories in Nature in Venice-Selected Short III</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./how-lisa-rinna-56-stays-so-freaking-fit.html>How Lisa Rinna, 56, Stays So Freaking Fit</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./how-lisa-rinna-56-stays-so-freaking-fit.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
