For me, the worst noise in the world is someone blasting their terrible music from their phone’s tinny speakers on the subway—seriously, if you do this, I pray you get slowly disemboweled with a pointy root vegetable. To block out all that racket, I’ve compiled a list of the best noise-canceling headphones available.</p><h2 id=our-picks-for-the-best-noise-canceling-headphones>Our picks for the best noise-canceling headphones</h2><h3>Best wired noise-canceling headphones: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Audio-Technica ATH-M50X</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best wired noise-canceling headphones</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Audio Technica ATH-M50X Professional Studio Monitor Headphones Black Bundle w/Pig hog 25’ Extension Cable & Liquid Polishing Cloth with Detachable Cable</h3></p><p>While few people these days use wired noise-canceling headphones on the go, they’re still the best option for those seeking world-class sound at home or at work. Dr. Reisman’s pick is Audio-Technica’s ATH-M50X, which she praises for their studio-quality sound and passive noise isolation. They also feature 90-degree swiveling ear cups, professional-grade ear pads and headband, and detachable cables, making them super user-friendly.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Headphone type: Over-ear</li><li>Battery life: N/A</li><li>Water-resistant: No</li><li>Return policy: Only for issues covered by warranty</li><li>Warranty: Two years</li><li>Price on publish: $169.99</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Swiveling ear cups</li><li>Collapsible</li><li>Comes with four cables (4 - 9 foot coil cable, 4-foot straight cable, 9-foot straight cable, 25-foot extension cable), screw-on adapter, carrying pouch, and polishing cloth</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Proprietary cable connections</li><li>Return policy only applies to issues covered by warranty</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>Studio-quality wired headphones at an extremely reasonable price.</p><h3>Best noise-canceling headphones under $100: <a rel=nofollow href=#>1MORE SonoFlow Wireless</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best noise-canceling headphones under $100</span></p><p><h3 class=title>1MORE SonoFlow Wireless</h3></p><p>Sadly, most cheap headphones are going to sound and feel exactly that—cheap. There are worthwhile buys under $100, though, and Mendez believes that 1MORE’s SonoFlow is the best of them. “1MORE has been known in the audio world to make some amazing products at affordable prices and these are no exception,” he says. He adds that, since they feature 1MORE's QuietMax™ technology (a proprietary active noise-cancellation improvement), LDAC support for Hi-Res audio over Bluetooth, and up to 70 hours of playback time, “These are a steal for their low price!”</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Headphone type: Over-ear</li><li>Battery life: 70 hours</li><li>Water-resistant: Yes</li><li>Return policy: Free returns, provided product is in unused condition</li><li>Warranty: One year</li><li>Price on publish: $63.99</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Incredible battery life</li><li>Inexpensive</li><li>Free returns</li><li>Five hours of play with just five minutes of charging</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>A minority of customer reviews say they are underwhelmed by the bass</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>An inexpensive pair of headphones with exceptional battery life.</p><h3>Best budget noise-canceling earbuds: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Soundcore Life P3</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best budget noise-canceling earbuds</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Soundcore Life P3</h3></p><p>These earbuds, also from Soundcore, come recommended by Ruth Reisman, AuD MBA CCC-A, founder and co-owner of <a rel=nofollow href=#>Urban Hearing</a> and full-time doctoral lecturer at the City University of New York. “I used these myself and found them to be a great budget find,” she says. “They have reliable active noise cancellation in a compact earbud design.” With a 4.4 out of 5 rating on Amazon from over 29,000 reviews, it’s clear most people agree.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Headphone type: Earbuds</li><li>Battery life: 7 hours (35 with the charging case)</li><li>Water-resistant: Yes</li><li>Return policy: 30-day money back guarantee</li><li>Warranty: 18 months</li><li>Price on publish: $79.99</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Affordable</li><li>Great active noise cancellation</li><li>Five nice color options</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>A small number of customer reviews complain that they don’t fit snugly in the ear</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>A compact, powerful, and affordable set of earbuds with great active noise cancellation.</p><h3>Best budget noise-canceling headphones: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Soundcore Space Q45</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best budget noise-canceling headphones</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Soundcore Space Q45</h3></p><p>Since noise-canceling headphones can get expensive, I’m starting my list with a pick for a more reasonably priced pair. Jeff Mendez of <a rel=nofollow href=#>El Jefe Reviews</a> recommends the Soundcore Space Q45, saying that, “Soundcore has become a force in the audio community over the past several years—their wireless headphones have seen multiple iterations and the Space Q45 are the culmination of these efforts.” He adds that with their strong active noise cancellation, HearID personalized sound (which creates an ideal sound profile based on your hearing), Hi-Res Audio certification, and exceptional battery life, they’re the best option for under $200.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Headphone type: Over-ear</li><li>Battery life: 50 hours</li><li>Water-resistant: Yes</li><li>Return policy: 30-day money back guarantee</li><li>Warranty: 18 months</li><li>Price on publish: $149.99</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Reasonably priced</li><li>Personalized sound</li><li>Great battery life</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>A minority of customer reviews say they run a little large</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>An inexpensive but feature-stuffed pair of headphones with great battery life.</p><h3>Best noise-canceling headphones for airplane use: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best noise-canceling headphones for airplane use</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones Sandstone</h3></p><p>For some weird reason, flying in a pressurized cabin full of people sitting on top of two 8,000-pound jet engines tends to be a somewhat noisy experience, so headphones that efficiently filter out those sounds are a huge plus when flying. “If you need the very best active noise cancellation for a flight, look no further,” says Mendez of Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra headphones. “Bose designed this product from the ground up for this exact use case—I tested these on a recent flight to Texas and the active noise-canceling strength was outstanding.”</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Headphone type: Over-ear</li><li>Battery life: 24 hours</li><li>Water-resistant: No</li><li>Return policy: 90 days</li><li>Warranty: Two years</li><li>Price on publish: $379</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Great active noise canceling</li><li>CustomTune technology adapts sound to your ears</li><li>Lightweight and comfortable</li><li>Three color options</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Very expensive, especially for something with so much plastic</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>An admittedly expensive pair of headphones, but with truly world-class active noise cancellation, ideal for blocking out the unwanted sounds of a plane ride.</p><h3>Best noise canceling headphones for Android users: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best noise canceling headphones for Android users</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless</h3></p><p>As well as being comfortable and featuring an impressive 60-hour battery life, these over-ear headphones from Sennheiser offer well-balanced sound and, through its companion Smart Control app, the ability to further tweak the sound to your liking.

Certainly, you won’t be happy if your headphones die with just three pages left in your audiobook.</p><h3>Comfort</h3><p>Even amazing-sounding headphones aren’t going to work out in the long run if they’re overly heavy, tight, or feel uncomfortable against your ears.</p><p>Read, Also: <a rel=alternate href=#>The Best Headphones for Sleeping Right Through the Night</a></p><h2 id=how-we-selected-the-best-noise-canceling-headphones>How we selected the best noise-canceling headphones</h2><p>All of my picks came from a panel of audio experts and headphone enthusiasts, who considered performance, features, sound quality, design, and value when making their selections. I also checked that all of my entries had strongly positive customer reviews.</p><p>If you found this list helpful, be sure to also look at our guides for the <a rel=alternate href=#>best headphones</a> and the <a rel=alternate href=#>best wireless earbuds</a>.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>Does noise cancellation block all noise?</h3><p>“Noise cancellation technology does not block all noise entirely,” says Dr. Sarow. “It primarily consists of two components: Active noise cancellation (ANC) and passive noise cancellation. ANC is particularly effective at reducing low-frequency sounds such as the rumbling of an airplane or road noise. However, it tends to be less effective against high-frequency sounds like whistling or wind noise. Additionally, loud, sudden noises will not be completely muffled. This is due to the fact that ANC works by sampling the environment and producing a 'counter-sound' to the external noise, a process that is less effective for sudden, impulsive noises.”</p><p>“On the other hand, passive noise cancellation relies on the physical properties of the headphones (such as the ear cup design and materials used) to block out noise,” she continues. “The combination of both technologies provides a strong noise reduction solution, but it's important to note that no headphones can entirely block out all external noise.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lnqS2tLGMnJinm5Whtq%2BzjKGcmpygnbyvsY4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-noise-canceling-headphone.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbest-noise-canceling-headphone.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbest-noise-canceling-headphone.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbest-noise-canceling-headphone.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-noise-canceling-headphone.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-noise-canceling-headphone.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./elton-john-aeg-jay-marciano-city-of-hope-1236107928.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./elton-john-aeg-jay-marciano-city-of-hope-1236107928.html>Elton John to Perform, AEGs Jay Marciano to Be Honored at City of Hope Gala</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./a-singer-who-had-most-of-his-body-burned-by-electrocution-is-embracing-his-uniqueness-815480.html>A Singer Who Had Most of His Body Burned by Electrocution Is Embracing His Uniqueness</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./a-singer-who-had-most-of-his-body-burned-by-electrocution-is-embracing-his-uniqueness-815480.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
