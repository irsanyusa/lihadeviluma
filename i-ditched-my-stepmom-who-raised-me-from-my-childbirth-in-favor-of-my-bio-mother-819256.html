<time>05 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>A&nbsp;woman, named Sarah, penned a&nbsp;heartfelt letter to&nbsp;our editorial. Sarah is&nbsp;torn by&nbsp;the sense of&nbsp;guilt that she’s feeling towards her stepmom, because the woman feels that she’s mistreated the person, who raised her like her own daughter. But at&nbsp;the same time, Sarah feels she had no&nbsp;other choice, because her biological mom showed up&nbsp;during the most significant event in&nbsp;her life. The woman gave&nbsp;us the details of&nbsp;this intricate family story, leaving it&nbsp;to&nbsp;our readers whether to&nbsp;judge her or&nbsp;to&nbsp;support her with a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;good advice.</p><p><h2>Sarah’s stepmother has always been the most significant person in&nbsp;her life.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4e2/75c/ed36c75e38aba9d8368787460e.jpg><p>Sarah, 26, has written a&nbsp;very emotional letter to&nbsp;our editorial. The woman told&nbsp;us her story, which provoked a&nbsp;hurricane of&nbsp;emotions among a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;people. Sarah confessed that many family members and friends, and even distant relatives, are now severely judging her for her deed. But the woman feels like there’s a&nbsp;grain of&nbsp;truth in&nbsp;her actions, too, and she explained her position in&nbsp;her story.</p><p>Sarah opened her letter, saying, “Hi, <strong>Bright Side</strong>! I&nbsp;am in&nbsp;a&nbsp;very controversial situation at&nbsp;the moment and I&nbsp;do need the opinions of&nbsp;your readers about my&nbsp;family case. My&nbsp;stepmother, Irene, is&nbsp;56&nbsp;years old. This woman has always been like a&nbsp;mother to&nbsp;me. She’s been raising me&nbsp;since&nbsp;I was&nbsp;4, and she has never even mentioned that we’re not related by&nbsp;blood, though&nbsp;I knew from the very beginning that she’s not my&nbsp;biological mom.<br>Irene has always been the best mom&nbsp;I could ever have. She’s a&nbsp;generous and loving woman, who has always been by&nbsp;my&nbsp;side when&nbsp;I needed her. She worked hard to&nbsp;support me&nbsp;throughout my&nbsp;life, she was the person who earned money with only one goal, and this was my&nbsp;happy childhood and financially protected future.”</p><p>Sarah added, “My&nbsp;dad and my&nbsp;bio mom split when&nbsp;I was&nbsp;3, and&nbsp;I hadn’t even heard of&nbsp;Alyson, my&nbsp;mother, ever since. When I&nbsp;became grown up&nbsp;enough to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;ask questions about my&nbsp;biological mother, my&nbsp;dad would always avoid talking about her, he&nbsp;would only call her an ’unworthy person’ and&nbsp;I could see it&nbsp;by&nbsp;the expression on&nbsp;his face, that their breakup was hurtful and dad was still raging because of&nbsp;it.”</p><p><h2>Sarah’s biological mother showed up&nbsp;unexpectedly, and turned the life of&nbsp;the whole family into a&nbsp;mess.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a4d/f5e/700fd25451ab8a8b2d4823720d.jpg><p>Sarah goes on&nbsp;with her story, saying, “When I&nbsp;say that my&nbsp;stepmother was the only person to&nbsp;raise and support me&nbsp;financially, I&nbsp;literally mean&nbsp;it, because my&nbsp;father died in&nbsp;a&nbsp;bad accident when&nbsp;I was 6&nbsp;years old. Since then, Irene has been the only breadwinner in&nbsp;our family.<br>My&nbsp;biological mom wasn’t in&nbsp;the picture all this time, and she didn’t even come to&nbsp;dad’s funeral. So, I&nbsp;was living all this time being aware of&nbsp;her existence, but&nbsp;I didn’t really know where she was, what she was up&nbsp;to, and&nbsp;I never made any attempts to&nbsp;find out more details about her. Something inside me&nbsp;always prompted to&nbsp;me&nbsp;that if&nbsp;dad was so&nbsp;hurt by&nbsp;their divorce, then&nbsp;I might also feel the same if&nbsp;I ever find my&nbsp;mother and find out the details of&nbsp;their story.”</p><p>Sarah added, “In&nbsp;the meantime, my&nbsp;life was going&nbsp;on. Irene paid for my&nbsp;<a href=# title=education data-link=tag>education</a> and&nbsp;I graduated with honors from a&nbsp;prestigious university. She accumulated the funds that she inherited from her parents and her own savings and bought me&nbsp;a&nbsp;small but nice apartment in&nbsp;the center of&nbsp;the city where we&nbsp;live.<br>Then, I&nbsp;met my&nbsp;husband-to-be, Josh. We&nbsp;got engaged and Irene was sincerely happy for&nbsp;us both. This strong and loving woman always treated me&nbsp;and my&nbsp;new family in&nbsp;a&nbsp;very decent and loving manner.”</p><p>The woman continues, saying, “At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;25&nbsp;I fell pregnant, and this was a&nbsp;significant event not only in&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;my&nbsp;long-awaited parenthood, but also for Irene, who was on&nbsp;cloud nine about the perspective of&nbsp;becoming a&nbsp;grandmother. And this was the exact point when my&nbsp;bio mother, Alyson, suddenly showed&nbsp;up. I&nbsp;got a&nbsp;call from an&nbsp;unfamiliar number one day, and this was her. She introduced herself, she said she understood my&nbsp;expected rage and rejection of&nbsp;her, but she begged me&nbsp;to&nbsp;meet her and to&nbsp;talk to&nbsp;her, and I&nbsp;agreed.”</p><p><h2>Sarah met Alyson for the first time, and this was a&nbsp;breaking point for both women.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e95/8b2/8e5299570389f894c6386cd88f.jpg><p>Sarah wrote, “My&nbsp;biological mom and&nbsp;I met in&nbsp;a&nbsp;small cafe near our house. I&nbsp;instantly recognized her when&nbsp;I walked&nbsp;in, because we&nbsp;do&nbsp;look so&nbsp;much alike. Irene knew about this meeting and when&nbsp;I told her about&nbsp;it, she was uncomfortable with&nbsp;it, but she didn’t object, and she even supported me&nbsp;in&nbsp;my&nbsp;wish to&nbsp;meet Alyson and listen to&nbsp;what she had to&nbsp;say.”</p><p>“Alyson told me&nbsp;the story of&nbsp;her and dad’s breakup. Turned out, there were many cases when she cheated on&nbsp;him, and he&nbsp;always forgave her for doing that to&nbsp;him. But once she fell pregnant with&nbsp;me, my&nbsp;dad became very suspicious and resentful, insisting that the baby wasn’t his, and he&nbsp;totally refused to&nbsp;believe that&nbsp;I was his child. Alyson got offended about his behavior, and there was a&nbsp;huge fight between them, which ended up&nbsp;in&nbsp;them being separated and then divorced.<br>Later&nbsp;on, dad insisted on&nbsp;a&nbsp;paternity test, which proved to&nbsp;be&nbsp;positive, and he&nbsp;accepted me&nbsp;as&nbsp;his child. He&nbsp;insisted that&nbsp;I must live with him from then&nbsp;on, and Alyson didn’t object, because, as&nbsp;she said, she wasn’t ready to&nbsp;devote her life to&nbsp;me&nbsp;at&nbsp;that point. Dad took a&nbsp;promise from her that she would never show up&nbsp;again and that she won’t try to&nbsp;contact me&nbsp;throughout my&nbsp;life, which Alyson did.”</p><p><h2>Sarah took a&nbsp;step that seems too much even to&nbsp;herself now, but she has an&nbsp;excuse for&nbsp;it.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/362/715/f8870c5ab3b2bcc3e1ac597c33.jpg><p>Sarah wrote, “I&nbsp;started communicating with Alyson from then&nbsp;on. When she found out that I’m pregnant, she was totally happy, and she asked me&nbsp;if&nbsp;she could be&nbsp;present in&nbsp;a&nbsp;delivery room. She explained that she wanted to&nbsp;witness how her grandson would be&nbsp;born, and&nbsp;I couldn’t say&nbsp;no.<br>In&nbsp;the meantime, Irene, my&nbsp;stepmom, didn’t mention that she would like to&nbsp;be&nbsp;present there. My&nbsp;pregnancy was an&nbsp;extremely tough experience, with a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;complications, and&nbsp;I could barely think of&nbsp;anything except my&nbsp;own wellbeing, so&nbsp;I never even asked Irene if&nbsp;she would want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;present during <a href=# title=childbirth data-link=tag>childbirth</a>.”</p><p>“When I&nbsp;started giving birth, Irene was beside&nbsp;me. She said she would go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the hospital with me&nbsp;and my&nbsp;husband and would be&nbsp;there, but&nbsp;I suddenly felt that this was wrong. As&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;I already said yes to&nbsp;Alyson, it&nbsp;hit me&nbsp;that this would be&nbsp;so&nbsp;inappropriate to&nbsp;have them both in&nbsp;the delivery room.<br>I&nbsp;felt like this was a&nbsp;sacred moment for me&nbsp;and these two women would be&nbsp;so&nbsp;negative towards each other, so&nbsp;I explained this to&nbsp;Irene. She went pale, she was so&nbsp;hurt. But she didn’t reproach me&nbsp;for anything, she just said she understood everything and that my&nbsp;maternal instinct must have been prompting me&nbsp;to&nbsp;have my&nbsp;bio mom with me&nbsp;at&nbsp;this special moment. She was saying a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;supportive words, but&nbsp;I somehow brushed them all off.”</p><p>Sarah wrote, “Alyson was present during the childbirth, and she was so&nbsp;happy to&nbsp;be&nbsp;given this opportunity. But now, as&nbsp;I’m writing this, I&nbsp;have such a&nbsp;bitter feeling about everything and about Irene. My&nbsp;stepmom absolutely adores her grandson, but she hasn’t visited me&nbsp;ever since.<br>Whenever we&nbsp;come to&nbsp;her place, she’s so&nbsp;happy to&nbsp;meet the baby, but not me&nbsp;anymore. She’s cold and reserved, and&nbsp;I don’t know what to&nbsp;do. Am&nbsp;I&nbsp;wrong to&nbsp;act like I&nbsp;did? How can&nbsp;I fix everything between me&nbsp;and Irene now? I’m lost.”</p><p>And here’s yet another family story that proves that the relationships between parents and kids are often far from the idyllic ones that are pictured in&nbsp;the movies and soap operas. <a href=#>Here’s a&nbsp;story</a> of&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman, 45, who decided to&nbsp;kick her youngest son out of&nbsp;their house, and her reasoning behind the decision has sparked a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;controversy among people.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLZusMitmqGdlGK6unnSrZyppZ%2Bieri0zmapmqGjmrFuucRmnaunnWK6unnCoaClnJKev7W0jKKlZp6Rq7yzec6fZKaxXZe2sHnMqKuhnaJihXKFkW5taA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fi-ditched-my-stepmom-who-raised-me-from-my-childbirth-in-favor-of-my-bio-mother-819256.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fi-ditched-my-stepmom-who-raised-me-from-my-childbirth-in-favor-of-my-bio-mother-819256.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fi-ditched-my-stepmom-who-raised-me-from-my-childbirth-in-favor-of-my-bio-mother-819256.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fi-ditched-my-stepmom-who-raised-me-from-my-childbirth-in-favor-of-my-bio-mother-819256.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fi-ditched-my-stepmom-who-raised-me-from-my-childbirth-in-favor-of-my-bio-mother-819256.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fi-ditched-my-stepmom-who-raised-me-from-my-childbirth-in-favor-of-my-bio-mother-819256.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-pole-dancing-grandma-shares-how-her-life-began-at-50-816104.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-pole-dancing-grandma-shares-how-her-life-began-at-50-816104.html>Meet the 53-Year-Old Pole-Dancing Grandma Who Says Her Life Began at 50</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./fresh-calls-emerge-for-removal-of-damagun-as-pdp-chair.html>Fresh calls emerge for removal of Damagun as PDP chair</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./fresh-calls-emerge-for-removal-of-damagun-as-pdp-chair.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
